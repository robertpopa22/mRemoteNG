Task Completed.
Fixed Issue #1304: Config is wiped when importing multiple *.RDG files.
- Removed static state from `RemoteDesktopConnectionManagerDeserializer` to fix race condition during parallel imports.
- Added `mRemoteNGTests/Config/Serializers/MiscSerializers/RemoteDesktopConnectionManagerDeserializerConcurrencyTests.cs` to reproduce and verify the fix.
- Verified that existing tests pass.
