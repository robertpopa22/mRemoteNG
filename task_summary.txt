I have implemented the "Variables" button in the `ExternalToolsWindow`.

**Changes:**
1.  **`mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ExternalToolsWindow.Designer.cs`**:
    *   Added `VariablesButton` (MrngButton) to the `tableLayoutPanel1`.
    *   Placed it next to the "Arguments" text box (Column 4, Row 2).
    *   Set the button text to "Variables" and wired up the `Click` event.

2.  **`mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ExternalToolsWindow.cs`**:
    *   Implemented `VariablesButton_Click` event handler.
    *   Created a `ContextMenuStrip` populated with supported variables:
        *   Connection Info: Name, Hostname, Port, Protocol, Description, MacAddress, EnvironmentTags.
        *   Credentials: Username, Password, Domain.
        *   User Fields: UserField, UserField1-10.
        *   Other: SSHOptions, PuttySession.
    *   Implemented `InsertVariable` helper method to insert the selected variable (e.g., `%Hostname%`) into the `ArgumentsCheckBox` text box at the current cursor position.

3.  **Tests**:
    *   Created a new test file: `mRemoteNGTests/UI/Window/ExternalToolsWindowVariablesTests.cs`.
    *   The test instantiates `ExternalToolsWindow`, simulates user input in the arguments box, and verifies that the `InsertVariable` method correctly inserts the variable text at the cursor position.
    *   The test passed successfully.

**Verification:**
*   Built the solution using `build.ps1` -> **Success**.
*   Ran the new test -> **Passed**.
*   Ran all tests -> **Passed 2609, Failed 4**. The failures appear to be unrelated to my changes (pre-existing serialization issues and flaky UI tests related to docking).

**Note:**
*   The `Arguments` field in the UI code is named `ArgumentsCheckBox` (likely a legacy name), but it is indeed a `MrngTextBox`, so the text insertion logic works correctly.
*   I used reflection in the unit test to access the private button and method because `ExternalToolsWindow` controls and methods are internal/private.
