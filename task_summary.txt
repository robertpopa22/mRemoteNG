I have completed the task. "Presentation Mode" is implemented, verified, and committed.

Summary of changes:
1.  **Created `mRemoteNG/UI/PresentationModeHandler.cs`**: Handles the logic for entering/exiting presentation mode (hiding/showing panels) and toggling RDP Smart Size.
2.  **Modified `mRemoteNG/UI/Menu/msMain/ViewMenu.cs`**: Added the "Presentation Mode" menu item (`Shift+F11`) and wired it to the handler.
3.  **Modified `mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/FrmMain.cs`**: Instantiated the handler.
4.  **Modified `mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/FrmMain.Designer.cs`**: Added a global key handler for `Shift+F11` to ensuring the toggle works even when the menu is hidden.
5.  **Documentation**: Created `ISSUE_1066_FIX_DETAILS.md`.

The build passed, and existing tests passed (with known environment-related exceptions unrelated to changes).
I am done.
