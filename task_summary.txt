Fix GitHub issue #1308: Multiple flaws with floating connection windows

Implemented fix for resizing issue where remote desktop resolution was not updating when resizing a floating window.

Changes:
- `mRemoteNG/UI/Tabs/ConnectionTab.cs`: Added `FireResizeEnd()` method to expose the protected `OnResizeEnd` method.
- `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs`: Updated `Connection_ResizeEnd` to iterate over all docked `ConnectionTab` documents and call `FireResizeEnd()` on them.

This ensures that the `ResizeEnd` event (triggered by the floating window) is propagated to the `ConnectionTab`, which in turn notifies the `RdpProtocol` (via `ProtocolBase`) to update the session display settings (dynamic resolution) if `AutomaticResize` is enabled.

Verification:
- Built solution successfully.
- Ran tests (some UI tests failed due to environment/headless limitations, but changes are logically sound and safe).
