I have implemented the fix for issue #1070 by adding the `ScriptErrorsSuppressed` property to `ConnectionInfo` and updating `HTTPBase.cs` to use it.

1.  Modified `mRemoteNG/Connection/AbstractConnectionRecord.cs`: Added `_scriptErrorsSuppressed` field (default `true`) and `ScriptErrorsSuppressed` property.
2.  Modified `mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfoInheritance.cs`: Added `ScriptErrorsSuppressed` property for inheritance.
3.  Modified `mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/Http/Connection.Protocol.HTTPBase.cs`: Updated to use `InterfaceControl.Info.ScriptErrorsSuppressed`.
4.  Modified `mRemoteNGTests/TestHelpers/SerializableConnectionInfoAllPropertiesOfType.cs`: Added `ScriptErrorsSuppressed` property to support existing tests.

I verified the changes with a new unit test `ScriptErrorsSuppressedTests.cs` (which passed) and ran existing `DefaultConnectionInfoTests` (which also passed).

The changes have been committed to the `main` branch.
