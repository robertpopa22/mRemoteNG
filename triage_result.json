  "decision": "implement",
  "reason": "The Connections panel (ConnectionTree, a TreeListView) scrolls unnecessarily when a node gains focus, likely due to an aggressive auto-scroll-on-focus behavior in the underlying TreeListView control.",

  "approach": "Investigate and disable or modify the TreeListView's auto-scroll-on-focus behavior in ConnectionTree.cs to prevent unwanted scrolling while ensuring the focused item remains visible when necessary (e.g., after adding a new node)."
