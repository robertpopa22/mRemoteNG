## Summary 
- restore horizontal auto-scroll while dragging document tabs across an overflowed tab strip 
- add edge-triggered scroll left/right based on pointer position during left-button drag 
- throttle scrolling to avoid rapid jump behavior during drag 
 
## Scope 
- file: mRemoteNG/UI/Tabs/DockPaneStripNG.cs 
- issue: #2161 
 
## Notes 
- isolated to DockPaneStripNG; no dependency/package changes 
- local toolchain unavailable in this shell (no dotnet/msbuild), so verification is CI/manual-repro oriented
