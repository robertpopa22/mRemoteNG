Summary
- harden document-tab close path under resize/reconnect layout churn
- validate tab index/content before close and defer close to UI queue
- avoid unhandled dock-layout race exceptions during queued close

Why
Issue #2166 reports close-tab crashes around RDP resize/reconnect.
One stack reaches DockPaneStripNG.TabCloseButtonHit/CloseContent during layout transitions.

Notes
- form-closing enumeration trace from #2166 is covered by parent PR #3124.

Validation
- local dotnet build reaches known COMReference gate MSB4803 in this shell/runtime
- full-framework msbuild sdk resolver is not fully wired in this shell; CI/manual repro is source of truth for this package
