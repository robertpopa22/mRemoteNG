Subject: Apology for automated comment spam — robertpopa22 fork

Hi Dimitrij,

I'm Robert Popa, the maintainer of the robertpopa22/mRemoteNG fork (Community Edition). I believe my account was blocked from the mRemoteNG organization, and I completely understand why.

What happened: I'm using an AI-assisted orchestrator to triage and fix issues from the upstream backlog. Unfortunately, a bug in my script's rate-limiting caused it to post ~36 comments within 76 seconds this morning (07:27-07:28 UTC), plus dozens more over the past two days — all with the same "Fix available for testing" template. I understand this looked exactly like bot spam, and I sincerely apologize for the disruption.

What I've done:
- Identified and fixed the rate-limiting bug in my orchestrator script
- I will no longer batch-post comments on upstream issues without manual review
- Future upstream communication will be consolidated (one PR + one discussion, not per-issue comments)

My contributions are genuine. The fork has real fixes for long-standing issues (self-contained builds, security hardening, 830-issue triage). PR #3134 consolidates everything into a single clean PR for your review.

I'd really appreciate being unblocked so I can continue contributing. I'm happy to discuss the best way to communicate fixes going forward — whether that's a single tracking issue, a discussion thread, or just the consolidated PR.

Thank you for maintaining mRemoteNG, and again, sorry for the noise.

Best regards,
Robert Popa
