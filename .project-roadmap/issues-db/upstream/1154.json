I was wondering if it would be possible to include some default common task items as part of the default install? (ping, tracert, computer management, etc.)\r\n\r\nI tried backing up my extApps.xml and then importing it into a new installation, but it didn\u0027t seem like anything saved so I had to rebuild my tools.\r\n\r\n",

I think I would have it add these default tools on the first run of mRemoteNG if the external apps file is empty. This should mimic being included in the installer.",
