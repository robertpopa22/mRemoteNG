I was wondering if it would be possible to include some default common task items as part of the default install? (ping, tracert, computer management, etc.)\r\n\r\nI tried backing up my extApps.xml and then importing it into a new installation, but it didn't seem like anything saved so I had to rebuild my tools.\r\n\r\n",
