When I open it up, and open an RDP in my connections tab, it always opens the General tab next to it, inside that little area. I always have to then move the General tab onto the larger section of my screen. I've tried saving everything (don't see a \"save panel layout\" option) and next time I close and re-open mRemoteNG it's the same story.",
