This would allow the ability to share connections with other members of our teams, but also allow us to restrict who has access to what sections within the application\r\n\r\nAlso having a local and centralized credentials manager would help as well with this",

Update the TreeView logic to intercept expansion/selection of locked nodes and prompt for credentials. Ensure serialization handles the per-folder security settings."
