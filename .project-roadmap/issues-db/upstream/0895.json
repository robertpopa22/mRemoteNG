It will be more convenient to manage a lot of route devices if they can. Can external extensions implement integration?\r\n\r\n![1](https:...",

Implement a protocol handler that launches the winbox.exe process with connection arguments and uses the application embedding logic (likely leveraging standard Windows API reparenting) to display it in a tab."
