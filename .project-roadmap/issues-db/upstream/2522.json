However, when this feature is enabled in the Connections Options (\"Single click on connection opens it\"), it does not only affects left-click but also right-click. I think it should not affect right-click.\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\u003c!--- If you\u0027re describing a bug, tell us what should happen -...",
