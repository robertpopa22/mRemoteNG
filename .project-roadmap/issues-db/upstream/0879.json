    "body_snippet":  "A very handy shortcut I use is to use ALT with a number to move among tabs. For example, ALT+1 would switch to tab 1, ALT+2 would switch to tab 2, and so forth. It would also be nice to have a customizable shortcut for duplicating and closing tabs, for example ALT+X to close and ALT+D to duplicate.\r\n\r\nI use mRemoteNG mainly as an SSH client so I am always using my keyboard and this would make switching tabs a lot easier.",
