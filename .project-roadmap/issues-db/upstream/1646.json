This is quite annoying.\r\n\r\nBut what is more annoying is that if from another session someone doesn't enter the custom password (pop-up password window loose the focus) and make any change, previous change are lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nStore custom encry...",

This issue requires a big workaround on the user side and makes it hard to keep the SQL database updated when using the SQL feature on a big scale. When everyone starts editing shortcuts, prompts appear so often that the software becomes unusable.\r\nI am looking forward to a fix.\r\n\r\nUsing: 1.77.3 Nightly Build: 1784",
