  "notes": "AI triage (codex): The request is a clear, low-risk enhancement with defined behavior and an obvious implementation point where the reconnection count cap is currently hard-limited to 20.\nApproach: Increase the RDP reconnection numeric maximum beyond 20 and keep validation aligned with that new upper bound so higher values persist and flow to RDP MaxReconnectAttempts.\nAI triage (codex): The issue is a clear enhancement request to make the current 20-attempt cap configurable for users who need higher retry limits.\nApproach: Introduce a configurable max connection-attempt setting with validation, use it in retry logic, and expose it in the Options UI."
