  "notes": "AI triage (codex): The request does not specify whether ODBC is for connection storage, import/export, or a new protocol, so scope and acceptance criteria are missing.\nApproach: Ask for the exact ODBC use case (provider/DSN/auth/read-write expectations), then add an ODBC connector path, wire it into options UI, and cover it with integration tests.\nAI triage (codex): ODBC support is a clear, in-scope extension of the existing database-backed connection list feature that currently uses provider-specific connectors.\nApproach: Add an ODBC connector and wire it into provider selection, registry validation, and connection testing, then extend SQL connection integration coverage for the new provider path."
