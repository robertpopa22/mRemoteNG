Once reconnected, the window size of the remote host is much smaller than it should be.  Signing out of the host \u0026 connecting again sorts out the issue.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nReconnecting should result in a regular window size.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nReconnecting results in a much smaller window size.\r\n\r\n## Steps ...",

A reconnect without logoff (right click tab name \u003e Reconnect) should also trigger a resize.\r\n\r\nBut yes a wrong window size from the beginning is not ideal and should be looked at, similar to when a monitor is disconnected (see #2142).",
