This provides the buttons for free, but adds a few cm of dead space at the top.\r\n- We reimplement the minimize, maximize, and close buttons as a separate toolbar which can be docked and moved like the external tools toolbar. Do we show this toolbar all the time, or just when in *Full Screen* mode?",

Show this panel when the mouse hovers near the top of the screen while in full screen mode (handled in FullscreenHandler). Connect the button events to frmMain's window state and close methods."
