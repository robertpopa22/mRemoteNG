This provides the buttons for free, but adds a few cm of dead space at the top.\r\n- We reimplement the minimize, maximize, and close buttons as a separate toolbar which can be docked and moved like the external tools toolbar. Do we show this toolbar all the time, or just when in *Full Screen* mode?",
