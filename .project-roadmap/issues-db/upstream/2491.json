      "snippet": "So I was looking for a solution to view multiple VNC sessions at the same time, and stumbled across mRemoteNG.  I got everything set up (I have 22 clients to watch) and come to find out it's just tabbed.  Minor disappointment, but still better than what I had (the TightVNC client).  Unfortunately, once I set up all 22 clients in a folder and try to connect to the folder, it opens maybe half of the clients, and I then watch as they drop, one-by-one.\r\n\r\nI tried this on the Stable 1.76.20 version, ...",
