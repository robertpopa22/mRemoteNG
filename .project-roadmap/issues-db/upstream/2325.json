    "body_snippet":  "Encryption of the connections file is great, but I would feel even safer if I could enable 2fa to even open the application,  I don\u0027t think it needs a user/pass to login, just a function to enable something like using google authenticator or Authy,  to 2fa into the app..  I do not save login info within mRemoteNG today because if i loose my laptop, its pretty easy to get into windows.    then they have the key to my servers. ",

For google authenticator and Authy no internet is needed let alone any encryption keys sent over the net.

The problem is (like @My1 statet) that you are not connecting to a backend that validates the second factor, but you are on that backend. This means an attacker that has access to your system and t...",
