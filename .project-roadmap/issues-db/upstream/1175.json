I then sometimes switch these to full screen which is why I need to hard code them at 1920x1080 to fit the full screen.  If I just set the session to smart size it will not take the full screen space when going full screen and if I set the session to full screen it will disc...",

When I connect to a server with AutoResize ON. It opens with 4k resolution on my 1080 monitor. \r\nAny way to make mRemoteNG respect the monitor it is on instead of the main one?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3281265/104329603-5f6ea080-54ed-11eb-85d2-90c4db2dd419.png)\r\n",

Modify SetResolution() default case to also enable SmartSizing when configured."
