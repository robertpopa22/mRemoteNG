There is a reason why there is a close and a minimize button from the application itself - and unless you want to minimize it to the notification area of the task bar (which I personally also don\u0027t understand why someone would want to do that ΓÇö maybe one could elaborate on that) I don\u0027t see a reason to change the original function of the button. \nThere is also already a verification prompt to not close it accidentally if that is the problem...
