At the current moment mRemoteNG has only one field name \"Userfield\", which can be passed by using %Userfield%. \r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5631071/37990964-18a85a2a-3208-11e8-851e-9093008fab08.png)\r\n\r\nMaybe this could be implemented together with https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/571 because those fields could also be ...",
