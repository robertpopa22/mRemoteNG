The external tool functionality is not a solution (I need to integrate the interface in a Panel). And I have a lot of problems with this particular server. So I need to access to the Chromium configuration. At time this is impossible (not right button menu available, nor any option to configure it).

Yes, I know this is a bad method to secure your network. However, a lot of environments have at time a huge number of servers/hardware/services using such certificates. And the MRN tool is a tool for _management_. So, we really need to connect to these devices... even using the self signed certificates.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the current WebV...",
