We are running MRemoteNG inside of a Citrix session and then just RDP’ing to servers using MRemoteNG.\r\n\r\nWe can see if there are any Citrix logs still if you want but we are not sure that it would show anything about APPS running in that Citrix session, possibly only details about how the Citrix session itself is running.  Let me know if you do still want the Citrix logs.\r\nThanks Ashlee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAshlee Newton\r\nTechnical Project Specialist...",

As I don't have the infrastructure to replicate the issue, but would like to help narrow it down:\r\n\r\n- Once reconnected with Citrix, does trying to open a new RDP connection in mRemoteNG result in any error messages in the notification panel (by default found at the bottom of the window) or is it empty? Or is there just a blank screen and nothing happens?\r\n- Is it only RDP which stops working after the reco...",
