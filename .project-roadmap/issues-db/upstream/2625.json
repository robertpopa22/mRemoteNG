We are running MRemoteNG inside of a Citrix session and then just RDPΓÇÖing to servers using MRemoteNG.\r\n\r\nWe can see if there are any Citrix logs still if you want but we are not sure that it would show anything about APPS running in that Citrix session, possibly only details about how the Citrix session itself is running.  Let me know if you do still want the Citrix logs.\r\nThanks Ashlee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAshlee Newton\r\nTechnical Project Speciali...",
