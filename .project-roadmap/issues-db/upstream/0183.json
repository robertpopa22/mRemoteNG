But this might not be an ideal user experience and there could be some security concerns with sending passwords on the command line that would be visible in taskmgr.\r\n\r\nIf we create a built in solution, this would likely provide the best user experience, at the expense of additional code maintenance and re-inventing the wheel...",

Basically, just allow the saving of a connection, similar to how other connections are done.  \r\nThere are two features I would suggest:\r\n1. The local and remote file paths should save a history, making those routine uploads really easy.\r\n2. Allow the save of explicit transfers including specific paths (i.e. a routine...",
