There are times it does, and times it does not.  As I write this description this morning, I am messing with multiple tabs open in Chrome, clicking between Chrome and mRemoteNG and different tabs in Chrome.  Sometimes the behavior does not manifest, and sometimes it does.\r\n\r\n|--:|---|\r\n|Operating system | Windows 7 x64 |\r\n|mRemoteNG ve...",
