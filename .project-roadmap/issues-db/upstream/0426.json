Something similar to the \"Macros\" concept that exists on MobaXterm.\r\n\r\neg: In a session, I would have to type in \"Command A\", followed by \"Command B\" \u0026 so on. If there could be a feature that automate this, it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nRelated Reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/mRemoteNG/comments/5wxom0/q_paste_commands/\r\n",
