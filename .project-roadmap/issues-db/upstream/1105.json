  "body_snippet": "Hi all. Was just wondering (and I feel like its already been suggested but couldn't see it in the issues list) if the panel windows can be more functional when it comes to resizing. For me when I pull a panel out it defaults to a tiny square that needs resizing the moment its made which is a little inconvenient.
