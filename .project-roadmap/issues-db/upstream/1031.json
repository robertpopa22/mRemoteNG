  "notes": "AI triage (gemini): Serialization failure (System.ArgumentNullException) causes XmlConnectionsSaver to write an empty file, leading to data loss. Triggered by null properties in ConnectionInfo (likely from RDMan import or specific settings).\nApproach: 1. Update XmlConnectionsSaver to validate that the serialized XML string is not empty before writing to disk. 2. Update XmlConnectionNodeSerializer28 (and older versions if needed) to null-coalesce all string properties (e.g., PuttySession ?? \"\") to prevent ArgumentNullException."
