We\u0027re currently using mRemoteNG instead of others because \"Redirect \u003e Key Combinations\" is available, but we trade this for custom resolutions in doing so.",

I\u0027m unable to type a custom resolution in to Appearance \u003e Resolution. Is there another way to set this, or a way to add custom entries to the dropdown menu? I can also pursue the subreddit, if best to do so there.",
