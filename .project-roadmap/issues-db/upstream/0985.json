  "body_snippet": "Hello!\r\nThank you for your work. I want to suggest an idea.\r\nIn my opinion, it would be convenient to make instead of multiple connections one entity, for example, a server at home. And there are several ways to connect it to the SSH, RDP, Https and so on. It would also be convenient to change the ip address depending on where you connect from, if you connect from home, then the connection is replaced with ip address eg 192.168.1.10.
