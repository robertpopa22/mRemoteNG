  "body_snippet": "I'd love to be able to use mRemoteNG to handle libvirt/QEMU SPICE protocol.  That would allow connections to libvirt/QEMU VMs even if there was some reason that networking was not working within the VM.  OS installs, upgrades, etc.  Oddball OSes that you don't know whether there's remote access.  Or, diagnosing networking issues in the VM.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would slot in well with the mRemoteNG's ethos.\r\n",
