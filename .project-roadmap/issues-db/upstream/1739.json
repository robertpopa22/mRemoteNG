That would allow connections to libvirt/QEMU VMs even if there was some reason that networking was not working within the VM.  OS installs, upgrades, etc.  Oddball OSes that you don\u0027t know whether there\u0027s remote access.  Or, diagnosing networking issues in the VM.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would slot in well with the mRemoteNG\u0027s ethos.\r\n",
