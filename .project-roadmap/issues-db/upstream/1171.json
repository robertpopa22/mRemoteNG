Some people (such as myself) coming from Remote Desktop Connection Manager, are use to selecting a connection via the connection tree.  In conjunction with using the option \"Single Click on opened connection in Connection Tree switches to opened Connection Tab\", it would mean that the connection tabs almost become defunct.\r\n\r\nThis is in relation to the feature request #1096.",

Maybe what is needed is to select the connection in the connection tree when the tab is changed meaning that the highlighted connection tree item will always match the selected tab?\r\n\r\nThis might be a better solution (and easier to implement?)",

The problem is we have a feature branch called \"RemoveMagicLib\" that is nearly ready to be merged into develop (see  #1258). This has been a long time in the making as there is no trusted source available for MagicLib and its been unmaintained for a very long time. #155 has been opened for a while and we're just getting to it.\r\n\r\nSo, I've merged the changed from develop ...",

I only ever connect to one remote desktop, and I have enabled the option \"Reconnect to previously opened sessions on startup\", so I do not need anything shown besides the regular window title bar so I can move the window maximized/half-screen/etc as needed. I see the latest nightly build supports hiding the menu bar too, so the only remaining wasted screen space is the tab bar (and I guess some unnecessarily thick window borders, too),",

Implement logic in ConnectionWindow to toggle tab visibility on the DockPanel, likely by adjusting DocumentStyle or using a custom theme/renderer properties if available in the docking library."
