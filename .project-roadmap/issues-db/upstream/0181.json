      "snippet": "There are a few reasons we've been looking into replacing PuTTY as the default ssh/etc client:\n- Tighter integration. We currently spawn a new PuTTY process off of mRemoteNG. It's essentially acting like any other external program you can define, just with a little more built-in support.\n- Better security. Because PuTTY is called as an external program, we have to pass host/username/**and password** data to it in clear text over the command line.\n- Better customization. Since SSH.Net is a librar...",
