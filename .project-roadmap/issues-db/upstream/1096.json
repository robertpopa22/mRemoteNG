Would it be possible to have a more obvious icon and make the text of active connections bold (see screenshot of Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager)?  Also, it would be great if the current active connection were automatically selected in the connection tree as you switch between tabs.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25157703/44827324-...",

Maybe increasing the icon size (and proportionally increasing the overlay size).\r\n\r\nOr since we might not want to take away the custom icons as they are actively used:\r\nadd a second icon dedicated to the connection status (if possible)\r\nRather than an overlay, replace the custom icon with the connected icon\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts...",
