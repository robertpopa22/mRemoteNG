Now I\u0027m facing a small bore and I wonder whether win11 21H2 is involved or not.\r\n\r\nSaid that I\u0027m a strong supporter of keyboard ALT-TAB to move between windows. Since using 1.77.3, the mRemoteNG window brings to the top, but it does not \"get the focus\". So, I must click onto it before starting typing.\r\n\r\nPlease, any suggestions are welcome.\r\npf",

Because for me this sounds like a manifestation of one of the already known issues like #1408, #2175, #1650, #208 or #1535 which were already introduced a long time ago...\r\n\r\nI feel your pain as it annoys me as well, and I hope this gets fixed soon...\r\n",
