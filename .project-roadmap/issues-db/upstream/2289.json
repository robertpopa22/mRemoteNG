Now I'm facing a small bore and I wonder whether win11 21H2 is involved or not.\r\n\r\nSaid that I'm a strong supporter of keyboard ALT-TAB to move between windows. Since using 1.77.3, the mRemoteNG window brings to the top, but it does not \"get the focus\". So, I must click onto it before starting typing.\r\n\r\nPlease, any suggestions are welcome.\r\npf",
