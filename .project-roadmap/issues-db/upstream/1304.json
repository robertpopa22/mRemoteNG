Also as many \"confCons.xml.<DATE-TIME>.backup\" files are wiped, as I imported RDG files (some were with saved credentials).\r\nDomain field in some imported connections cotains \"Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\" and cannot be changed.\r\nApplication cannot be started because of zero-sized confCons.xml file.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
