I'd like to be able to have an instance of mRemoteNG open in each of these virtual desktops.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that if I make a change to my connections in one instance and save the connection file, and a different change in another instance and save again, only the most recently saved version persists.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if mRemoteNG could periodically (or automatically via file watching) refresh the ...",
