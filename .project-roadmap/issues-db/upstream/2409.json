I expect Connection tab to be auto-collapsed back to original state (like in left site of image), but it stats displayed like on right site of image for ever. I expect this to happen only if I pin the Connection dialog, but I didn't.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10895030/227775628-fde0345a-300e-439a-aa86-09caf9a86b6a.pn...",
