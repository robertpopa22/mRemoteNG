This makes it impossible to tell which tab belongs to which folder.\n\nExample:\n\nFolder A ΓåÆ Linux.11\n\nFolder B ΓåÆ Linux.11\n\nOpened at the same time, both tabs show only Linux.11\n\nRequest\nAdd an option in Settings to include the folder (or full folder path) in the tab title. For example:\n\nLinux.11 ΓÇö Folder A\n\nLinux.11 ΓÇö Folder B\n\nor \n\nLinux.11 / Folder A\n\nLinux....",
