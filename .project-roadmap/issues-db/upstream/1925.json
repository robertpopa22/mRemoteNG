Clicking or selecting with arrow keys is still possible but with a long list a groups the top ones will disappear from view fast.\r\n\r\nUsing mRemoteNG 1.76.20 on Windows Server 2012 R2. I think it also happened with previous releases.\r\n\r\nFrequency is hard to tell, maybe once every two months? Restarting the application fixes the issue.",
