To me it looks like as if TMDS just tries to block an outgoing RDP session which was generated when a user is connected through RDP, and as soon as the initial connection is supended TMDS let's the connection happen.\r\n\r\nThis might be solely Trend Micro's fault and I expect it to have nothing to do that you use mRemoteNG to connect to the Jump System (prove me wrong). I suggest you contact your se...",
