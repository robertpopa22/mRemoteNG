We would need to change how the \"Reconnect to previously opened sessions on startup\" option is implemented to make this work. \r\n\r\nThis would be new functionality as no previous version ever supported reconnecting to quick connect entries.\r\n\r\n*Dev note:*\r\nCurrently, we save a `PleaseConnect` flag on each connection in the connect...",
