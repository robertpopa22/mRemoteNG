      "snippet": "**Purpose of proposed changes:**\nRemove `RootNodeInfo` from the `ConnectionInfo` object graph.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- We do not want to re-implement the `ContainerInfo` code, so we want to have a base implementation that both `ContainerInfo` and `RootNodeInfo` can use. Thus, `ContainerInfo` should implement `ITreeNodeContainer` and delegate its implementation to a `TreeNodeContainerBase` through composition.\n- We will want a type to encapsulate the `ConnectionInfo`, `ContainerInfo`, and `RootNod...",
