That way the Reconnect and Reconnect All functionality could be used for reestablishing those lost connections.\r\n\r\nThis is already how the putty (SSH) sessions function, but I think it would still require some extra work for the RDP sessions to get that as well.",

Would be an awesome feature, also for laptops that use it on the go and lose connectivity more often due to WIFI or moving to a different location.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I don\u0027t want it to automatically try to reconnect since someone else is using the servers but I want the tabs open when I come in so I know what servers I was working on and can easily reconnect.  I guess the auto reconnect might cover that but it doesn\u0027t seem like it would....",
