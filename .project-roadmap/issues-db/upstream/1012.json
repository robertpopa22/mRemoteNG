However when we temporary lose internet connection for a longer time the RDP sessions will retry connecting but after a while they will be disconnected and I am not able to see what RDP sessions I had opened up.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nI would like to see what RDP sessions have been disconnected because it will not show you which ones you had opened up.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nAt this moment after longer period of losing connectivit...",

Would be an awesome feature, also for laptops that use it on the go and lose connectivity more often due to WIFI or moving to a different location.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

During the week other people RDP to servers and it kicks me out.  I don't want it to automatically try to reconnect since someone else is using the servers but I want the tabs open when I come in so I know what servers I was working on and can easily reconnect.  I guess the auto reconnect might cover that but it doesn't seem like it would....",
