The reason why you can\u0027t reconnect is, that the other connections allocated more memory during runtime, reducing the remaining memory below the required minimum for a new connection. \n\n(See also https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/2090#issuecomment-1076084444)\n\nTo work around this you may want try the 64-bit Version (released with 1.77.2-NB and newer)",
