When connections are not stored in the Connections file, mRemoteNG asks for credentials when using the integrated \"Reconnect\" option, but unlocks the session immediately whenever the resolution changes (resizing, maximizing the mRemoteNG window).\r\nI agree, looks like this is a bug.\r\nAs a workaround, you can set the resolution to \"Smart size\" for your connections. This will keep the initial RDP resolution, even when the mRemote panel\u0027s resolution changes.",
