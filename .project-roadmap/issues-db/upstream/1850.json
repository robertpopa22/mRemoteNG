I want to propose an approach that if no inheritance is applied, nothing will be serialized to connection xml. That way we can gain some file size and cpu usage IMHO.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\r\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\r\nWhen ...",
