See #420, #1907, #1568, etc. In fact the discussion over this functionality it's very old.\r\n\r\nSo, as the project is relaunched, I want to suggest to mark the WIDE SUPPORT OF SOCKS4 as high priority. Let me to explain what signifies this support:\r\n- For _every_ TCP connection, it will possible to connect directly or through a SOCKS4 proxy server.\r\n- Then you can tunnel directly any connection using for example a...",

And now using a SSH sever connected to the Internet and the LAN where are our server are, then we can connect to them. This is true with all protocols, including the RDP protocol. Great!\r\nHowever, when the bridge for the access is not a public SSH server but a VPN with a HTTP/SOCKS proxy we can't use the MRNG.\r\n\r\nThen, as ...",

  "notes": "AI triage (gemini): Implement SOCKS4 proxy support for VNC connections and activate existing VNC proxy functionality which is currently not utilized by VncSharpCore.\nApproach: Extend VNCEnum.ProxyType with SOCKS4. Develop proxy clients for SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP to establish proxied network streams/sockets. Modify ProtocolVNC.Connect() to use a ProxyClientFactory to create and utilize the appropriate proxy client based on ConnectionInfo.VNCProxyType, and then pass the established proxied stream/socket to VncSharpCore.RemoteDesktop. Update the UI to include the SOCKS4 option and add corresponding localization strings. Ensure comprehensive unit tests are added for the new SOCKS4 functionality and existing proxy types."
