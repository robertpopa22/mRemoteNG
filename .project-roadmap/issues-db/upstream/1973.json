See #420, #1907, #1568, etc. In fact the discussion over this functionality it\u0027s very old.\r\n\r\nSo, as the project is relaunched, I want to suggest to mark the WIDE SUPPORT OF SOCKS4 as high priority. Let me to explain what signifies this support:\r\n- For _every_ TCP connection, it will possible to connect directly or through a SOCKS4 proxy server.\r\n- Then you can tunnel directly any connection using for example a...",

The reason is because the current implementation (nightly build) is great. And now using a SSH sever connected to the Internet and the LAN where are our server are, then we can connect to them. This is true with all protocols, including the RDP protocol. Great!\r\nHowever, when the bridge for the access is not a public SSH server but a VPN with a HTTP/SOCKS proxy we can\u0027t use the MRNG.\r\n\r\nThen, as ...",
