We coded a little application to generate an mRemotNG XML configuration based on our data. The idea is to generate that configuration once and distribute such file over our company. \r\n\r\nWe don't understand how to encrypt correctly each remote desktop login password to make you application read it correctly. Do you have any suggestions? Maybe is there the possibility to encrypt / decrypt such passwords with a c...",
