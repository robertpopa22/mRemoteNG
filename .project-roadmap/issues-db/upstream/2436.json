Group could be taged and dont nessesary be in same folder. I beleave that will give enoght flexibility to end users. One more thing what i would like to implement is a extensions or plugins, so any developer may make an addon to extend providers to any flavour :) but need a bit work on implementation, but that I am moving forwards t...",
