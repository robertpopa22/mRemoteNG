This is a big shortcoming to filtering.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nFiltering connections should consider all connections within the connection tree. If a match is within a collapsed folder structure, the folders should be expanded to show the matching connection.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nMatching entries within collapsed folders are not included in the filtered connecti...",

If we listen for that event and set the `args.FilteredObjects` property, we can essentially override the normal filtering behavior with our own logic. This would let us search within folders and expand folders as needed before returning the list of filtered objects.\r\n\r\nWe might be able to reuse the logic used in the search class, which would cut down on development work.",
