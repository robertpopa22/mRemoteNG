One is the user configuration, and the other is the connection config. Both files are stored in the Appdata folder of mRemoteNG. If you create a default user configuration file containing the Database settings, you can just replace the file of the user and he\u0027s ready to go. ",

A little messy but I\u0027ll give it try.  However I still think its a useful FR to have the connection config live in $programdata",
