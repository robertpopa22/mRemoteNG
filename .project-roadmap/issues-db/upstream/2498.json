One is the user configuration, and the other is the connection config. Both files are stored in the Appdata folder of mRemoteNG. If you create a default user configuration file containing the Database settings, you can just replace the file of the user and he's ready to go. ",

Since mRemoteNG is per machine installation, any user new or existing logging in has the application already.   \r\nI think I know where you are going with this, I can create a default configs then create a local logon batch script to copy them into the users %appdata% location.  A little messy but I'll give it try.  However I still think its a useful FR to have the connection config live in $programdata",
