This doesn\u0027t work when using the `Connect (without credentials)` option, as you have found. We can fix this for some protocols, but maybe not all of them.\r\n\r\nFor RDP:\r\nThe `OnUserNameAcquired` event fires when the RDP connection receives a username. It provides the login user information as `domain\\username`. We can use this to update the tab name even when using the `Connect (without credentials)` option.",
