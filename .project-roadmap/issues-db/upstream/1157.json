We can fix this for some protocols, but maybe not all of them.\r\n\r\nFor RDP:\r\nThe `OnUserNameAcquired` event fires when the RDP connection receives a username. It provides the login user information as `domain\\username`. We can use this to update the tab name even when using the `Connect (without credentials)` option.",

The fix is to re-append this information in PuttyBase if the option is enabled.\nApproach: Modify PuttyBase.ResolveTabText to check Properties.OptionsTabsPanelsPage.Default.ShowLogonInfoOnTabs and append the configured username/domain to the resolved terminal title, ensuring consistency with ConnectionWindow behavior."
