It would be terrific if I could create a template connection that has my credentials (or inherits them), and when I launch it, I\u0027m prompted for the host to connect to.  If the connection is successful, it would then ask me if I wanted to save the connection. ",

So I find myself using quick-connection about as much as my saved connections.",
