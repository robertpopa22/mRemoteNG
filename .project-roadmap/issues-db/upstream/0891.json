  "body_snippet": "To save screen space, it would be very helpful to have the connection tree also as a menu (along with File, View, etc...). This way I could close the Connections panel and still access everything through a menu, saving space on lower resolution screens. Something like \"Connections\" and then a hierarchical menu with folders, connections, etc... would work nicely.\r\n\r\nThis currently is somewhat achievable if you show the Quick Connect Toolbar as clicking on the little blue globe has this informatio...",

  "notes": "AI triage (codex): The issue provides only a title with no behavior details, scope, or acceptance criteria to implement against.\nApproach: Request the exact menu items, where and when the menu should appear in the connection tree, and clear expected behavior before coding.\nAI triage (codex): The issue has no description or comments, so the requested connection tree menu behavior and acceptance criteria are undefined.\nApproach: Request exact menu items, trigger points (right-click/top menu), and expected actions before implementation.\nAI triage (gemini): User requests a top-level 'Connections' menu mirroring the connection tree to allow access when the panel is hidden, saving screen space.\nApproach: Create a new 'Connections' menu in the main menu bar mirroring the connection tree structure. Populate it dynamically based on the current ConnectionTreeModel."
