This works great by increasing the default wait time from 2 seconds to 10 seconds for the VM to start, and then it runs integrated with the mRemoteNG container!  What I would like to do though, is get the current resize code that triggers after the external app has been launched, to also trigger when the external app decides to resize itself for some reason.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nSo, I would like a setting th...",

Therefore, I would assume that the child application (VMWare Client) doesn\u0027t handle resizing.

There are Window Event message debuggers you can use to check what messages arrive on a windows hand...",
