  "notes": "AI triage (gemini): TightVNC connections are closing unexpectedly without explicit error messages, indicating an underlying issue that causes the 'graceful' disconnection.\nApproach: Investigate the `VNCEvent_Disconnected` handler and other event subscriptions in `mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/VNC/Connection.Protocol.VNC.cs` to understand why `VncSharpCore.RemoteDesktop` might be disconnecting unexpectedly. This may involve adding detailed logging around `VncSharpCore` events to identify the trigger for these 'graceful' closures."
