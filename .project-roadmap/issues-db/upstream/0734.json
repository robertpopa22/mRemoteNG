I\u0027m not a developer so I don\u0027t know the best way to go about it. Maybe command line options or an API etc. As an example of what I would like to accomplish would be WoX launcher starting saved kitty/putty connections. This could possibly be related to this issue: https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/5...",
