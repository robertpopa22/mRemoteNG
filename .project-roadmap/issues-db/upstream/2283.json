I have the \"PuTTy bell\" already disabled but that does not affect he MultiSSH bar. mRemoteNG is not in Win10 volume mixer so it can\u0027t be explicitly muted. As i can see the bell sound belongs to \"System sound\" (or at least that bar gets bumped up in volume mixes for a second when multiSSH command is sent)\r\n\r\nThe global \"Mute\" option would be more than enough to suppress these annoyances :)\r\n\r\nThanks !",
