Though I don't really care as I just set the windows sound scheme to \"No Sound\"/mute the system sound channel, which mutes almost all annoying popup-alerts. Upon that I put the speakers on mute (I generally use headphones though), so I don't really care to be honest.\r\n\r\n",

      "snippet": "The \"Bell\" sound after every use of MultiSSH is annoying. I have the \"PuTTy bell\" already disabled but that does not affect he MultiSSH bar. mRemoteNG is not in Win10 volume mixer so it can't be explicitly muted. As i can see the bell sound belongs to \"System sound\" (or at least that bar gets bumped up in volume mixes for a second when multiSSH command is sent)\r\n\r\nThe global \"Mute\" option would be more than enough to suppress these annoyances :)\r\n\r\nThanks !",
