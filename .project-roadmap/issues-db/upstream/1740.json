    "body_snippet":  "Hi, thaks for this awssome program. \r\n\r\nNow the Port Scan Tool result in a table that can\u0027t be ordered, so if you want import several hosts, you need to find it in the table. Order by column helps that action.\r\n\r\nWhen you want import a host wich has two possible connections, you need do it for each one. For example, I have a host with ssh and https services, I\u0027d like to import both services in a one step.\r\n\r\nIt will be great that the Host/IP column doesn\u0027t hide the ip when resolve dns name.\r\n┬┐C...",
