The current implementation of RdpErrorCodes.GetError does not receive the hostname.\nApproach: Modify `RdpErrorCodes.GetError` to accept `hostname` as a parameter, update `Language.RdpErrorUnknown` in `Language.resx` to include `{0}` for the hostname in its format, and pass the `connectionInfo.Hostname` from `RdpProtocol.cs` to `RdpErrorCodes.GetError` in the `RDPEvent_OnFatalError` method."
