I can use the context menu \u003e Reconnect option over and over and get the same results with a 4360 error. Then, sometimes, I can click the box that says \u0027reconnect when ready\u0027 and that works.

It helped me to add a new entry for \"TERMSRV/*\" into\r\nControl Panel\\All Control Panel Items\\Credential Manager -\u003e Windows Credentials -\u003e Add a generic credential.\r\nUse any fake username and password there.\r\n\r\nWith this fix in place and with some of our servers I also encountered issue #540. Fixed it by gpedit.msc / enabling \"Allow Delegating Saved Credentials with NTLM-only Server Authentication\".",
