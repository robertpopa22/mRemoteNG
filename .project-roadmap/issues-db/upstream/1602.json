Having a separate instance of PuTTY installed isn't a great way to handle SSH for a console application that is supposed to be a single app for all consoles.  I've got many places where they use PuTTY and it causes tons of confusion about which PuTTY they need to add saved sessions or which PuTTY agent they need to run for unlocking their keyfiles. \n\nAt a minimum, t...",
