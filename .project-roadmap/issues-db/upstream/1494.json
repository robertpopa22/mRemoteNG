No error is presented. The connection may drop after a minute or 2 or sometimes 10 to 15 or not at all. It's kind of random but improves with subsequent reconnects. After 2 or 3 reconnects, it seems fine. I've been able to confirm the issue also happens with another person in another state to the same servers. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce...",
