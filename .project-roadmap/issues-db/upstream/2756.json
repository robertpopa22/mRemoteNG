Issue appears to be due to the applied wanting to write to **mRemoteNG.appSettings** within the same folder as the executable.\n\n**Solution (Possible)?**\n\nConsider moving the **mRemoteNG.appSettings** file so it is loaded from AppData Roaming (similar to connection files), rather than within the same folder as the executable.\n\nhttps://gi...",

      "snippet": "Hey @Kvarkas \n\nScenario I'm looking at (and suspect this is common), is a folder with the mR binaries that would be read only (as users shouldn't be changing the binaries) for simultaneous access (on the same system - multi-session host) for 20 to 30 people.\n\nAs the folder is read only, the database file, like you said is unable to create/write the db file.\n\nWith that in mind, the question I have is:\n\n1. Is the DB expected to support multiple users accessing the same file at the same time?\n2. Ca...",

In short - plan to have few dbs - one for mR settings (some general ones like what is admin user, integrations with AD, DB, Azure, CyberArk (you named) what mean on installation it need admin account to be created and saved, later it will be working in read-only mode, second dbs for user profile and personal settings (like windows size, default endpoints to open, color theme etc.) wh...",
