  "body_snippet": "This is to track resolution of CII requirement `no_leaked_credentials`\r\n> The public repositories MUST NOT leak a valid private credential (e.g., a working password or private key) that is intended to limit public access. \r\n\r\nThis requirement is broken because we use a default password for encryption unless a user provides a custom one. To resolve this, we must require a user defined password for encryption.\r\n\r\nPossible related enhancements include:\r\n- #187 \r\n- #255 ",
