  "notes": "AI triage (gemini): Introduce a new option to allow users to customize the application's configuration path, enhancing flexibility for portable installations or specific deployment scenarios.\nApproach: 1. Add a new UserScopedSetting in Settings.settings for the custom configuration directory path. 2. Create a new 'ConfigurationPage' under mRemoteNG\\UI\\Forms\\OptionsPages with UI elements (textbox, browse button) to allow users to specify and apply a custom path. 3. Modify FrmOptions.cs to include and manage this new 'ConfigurationPage'. 4. Update SettingsFileInfo.cs to dynamically use the custom path from the settings if it's defined, otherwise fall back to default locations. 5. Implement logic to handle the migration of existing configuration files when the path is changed by the user, ensuring data integrity and providing appropriate user prompts."
