  "notes": "AI triage (gemini): The user wants pop-up notifications to be integrated into a panel within the main application window for improved user experience and less intrusive alerts.\nApproach: Identify the code within `PopupMessageWriter.cs` responsible for creating and displaying pop-up notifications. Modify their behavior to anchor them to a specific UI panel (e.g., a status bar or a dedicated notification area) within the `FrmMain` window, rather than appearing as independent, free-floating windows. This might involve creating a custom `UserControl` to host the notifications or integrating with an existing panel in `FrmMain`."
