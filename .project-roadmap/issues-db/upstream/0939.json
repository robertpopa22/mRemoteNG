It would be nice to be able to right click and update manually as we...",

This feature request implies extending it to other sources (e.g., generic scripts, files, or URL) to make it truly dynamic for all users.\nApproach: Extend `DynamicSourceType` enum with new sources (e.g., `Script`, `File`). Update `DynamicFolderManager.RefreshFolderInternal` to handle these new types by invoking the appropriate importer or script parser to populate `ContainerInfo.Children`."
