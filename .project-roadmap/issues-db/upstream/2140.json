If I connect while the software is running and if I had something on my local computer's clipboard, server's clipboard is updated. T...",

As far as I know you can only or completely disable or fully enable it, I don't think it's possible to only send the information after the first copying when using the mstsc (or the library thereof used in this project I forgot the name of), though I like to be proven wrong :)",
