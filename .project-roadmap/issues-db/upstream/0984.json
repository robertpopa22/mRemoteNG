    "body_snippet":  "This is only a feature suggestion.\r\nFrom time to time, when I have a lot of connections and folders created, I want to have some kind of shortcut, or something similar to a symbolic link created pointing to another connection. Currently I have a \"_Quick\" folder and a bunch of duplicated connections. It works fine but when I need to update the connection configurations, I have to update both the original one and the duplicated one. It would be nice if I can create a link to a connection.\r\nThanks!",
