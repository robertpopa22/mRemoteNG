  "body_snippet": "This is only a feature suggestion.\r\nFrom time to time, when I have a lot of connections and folders created, I want to have some kind of shortcut, or something similar to a symbolic link created pointing to another connection. Currently I have a \"_Quick\" folder and a bunch of duplicated connections. It works fine but when I need to update the connection configurations, I have to update both the original one and the duplicated one. It would be nice if I can create a link to a connection.\r\nThanks!",

  "notes": "AI triage (codex): This is a clear quality-of-life feature request that can reduce duplicate entries and ongoing config maintenance.\nApproach: Introduce a linked-connection entry that stores a reference to a source connection and resolves shared settings at runtime instead of copying values.\nAI triage (codex): This is a clear user-facing enhancement with maintainer-positive feedback and can be built on top of the existing duplicate-node workflow.\nApproach: Add a new 'Create Link' action that stores a reference to an existing connection and reuses the target settings at runtime instead of deep-cloning properties.\nAI triage (claude): Feature request to support connection aliases/links instead of full duplication, reducing sync issues when the same connection appears in multiple folders\nApproach: Add a LinkTarget property to ConnectionInfo that references another connection's ID. When a connection is a link, it delegates all property reads to the target. Serializers save/load link references. Tree operations offer 'Create Link' alongside 'Duplicate'.\nAI triage (gemini): Feature is already implemented in the codebase (ConnectionInfo, ConnectionTree, ContextMenu) and verified with tests.\nApproach: Verify and merge existing implementation of linked connections."
