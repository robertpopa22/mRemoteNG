  "notes": "AI triage (gemini): The issue describes a UI bug (blinking panel order) that affects user experience when closing panels.\nApproach: Investigate the panel closing logic in `ConnectionWindow.cs`, focusing on `OnConnectionTabFormClosing` and `Connection_FormClosing` events. Analyze the sequence of operations for panel re-arrangement and activation after a panel is closed. The fix will likely involve minimizing redraws or layout updates, possibly by strategically using `SuspendLayout()` and `ResumeLayout()` on the `DockPanel` or related controls, or re-ordering operations to ensure a smoother visual transition."
