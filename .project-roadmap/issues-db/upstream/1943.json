Direct remote access with Tiger VNC program allows multiple access at the same time.  When connecting to VNC remotely from mRemoteNG, please tell us why the simultaneous connection is not possible.",

This may involve adding a new connection property, exposing existing `VncSharpCore` capabilities, and updating the UI to allow configuration."
