  "notes": "AI triage (claude): Feature request to integrate Microsoft LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution) for retrieving local admin credentials from Active Directory, useful for IT admins managing domain-joined machines\nApproach: Add a LAPS credential provider that queries AD (ms-Mcs-AdmPwd or ms-LAPS-Password attribute) for the target host and injects the retrieved password into the connection at connect time. Requires LDAP query to AD using System.DirectoryServices, with caching and error handling for hosts not enrolled in LAPS."
