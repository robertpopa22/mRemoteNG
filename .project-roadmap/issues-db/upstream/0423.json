Setting persisted in Properties.OptionsDBsPage.Default.SQLReadOnly. Dual-layer write suppression: SqlConnectionsSaver.Save() line 45 and SqlDataProvider.Save() line 36 both check the flag and abort with informational messages. Registry/GPO enforcement supported via OptRegistrySqlServerPage.SQLReadOnly. Load operations work unconditionally (no read-only checks). No code changes needed."
