With mRemoteNG selected and on top (whether maximized or not) selecting another window from the taskbar sometimes results in that window being minimized instead of being brought to the front (as if mRemoteNG was not selected).

My guess is that there is an edge case there that we aren\u0027t accounting for and it\u0027s causing this behavior.\r\n\r\nFor reference, this is happening in frmMain.cs in method \r\n`protected override void WndProc(ref System.Windows.Forms.Message m)`",
