As RDP is set to \"smart size\", the remote desktop is resized accordingly. Unfortunately, even if remotely open windows are minimized, Windows resizes all open Windows to scale as well.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if the pane size was retained. Alternatively, an option made available to set either a fixed size, or percentage or screen sent to.\r\n\r\n* Version us...",
