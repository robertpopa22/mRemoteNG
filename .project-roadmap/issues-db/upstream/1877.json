  "notes": "AI triage (gemini): The application generates screenshots but lacks a user interface for managing and deleting these files, which contradicts documentation suggesting a 'Screenshot Manager' with deletion capabilities.\nApproach: Implement a dedicated 'Screenshot Manager' UI as a new form/dockable window that lists all saved screenshots from the designated directory. This manager will provide functionality to view and delete selected screenshots. An entry point to this manager will be added to the main application UI, possibly via the existing connection tab context menu or a new menu item."
