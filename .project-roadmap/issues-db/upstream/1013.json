This request is accepted as an enhancement to restore a simplified 'Take Screenshot' feature with automatic, configurable naming (e.g., ConnectionName_Timestamp) to replace the deprecated manager.\nApproach: Restore the 'Take Screenshot' context menu option in ConnectionTab. Implement logic to capture the screen and automatically save the file to a configured 'Screenshots' directory using a timestamp-based naming pattern."
