Look into replacing the `msRdpClient8.Reconnect()` call with a manual disconnect / reconnect to see if it is more reliable.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nReconnecting to an RDP session for a resize operation should complete in a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nSometimes reconnecting to an RDP ...",
