The others are technically not graphical interfaces and Windows will likely not generate a handle for the UI for us to attach to. However, we are discussing some changes (see #710 if you're interested) that may allow some of them at least to make the attempt. Git Bash doesn't seem to get a MainWindowHandle assigned, so that one will not work even with the proposed changes and other bug fixes. cmd...",
