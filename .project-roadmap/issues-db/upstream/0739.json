  "notes": "AI triage (gemini): Feature request to allow importing or syncing connections from Apache Guacamole's database, expanding supported connection sources.\nApproach: Implement a new import provider in the Import Wizard that connects to the Guacamole database (MySQL/PostgreSQL), queries the connection tables, and maps the fields to mRemoteNG connection info objects.\nAI triage (codex): The issue body and comments provide no actionable requirements, so the integration scope cannot be defined yet.\nApproach: Request concrete requirements for database version/support, authentication model, sync behavior, and expected UI/UX flow, then scope implementation.\nAI triage (codex): The issue has no body or comments describing required behavior, database schema expectations, or acceptance criteria for Guacamole integration.\nApproach: Ask for concrete use cases, sync direction (import/export/live), supported Guacamole schema/version, and security constraints before scoping implementation.\nAI triage (codex): The issue lacks required details (database type/version, read/write scope, authentication method, and expected user workflow) so it cannot be reliably scoped for implementation.\nApproach: Request concrete requirements and acceptance criteria, then implement a Guacamole data-provider layer plus import/sync UI with corresponding tests.\nAI triage (codex): The issue has no body or comments, so the scope, expected behavior, and acceptance criteria for Guacamole database integration are undefined.\nApproach: Request specific use cases, target Guacamole schema/version, desired data flow (import/sync/export), security constraints, and UI expectations before scoping implementation.\nAI triage (codex): The issue has no body or comments, so the requirements and expected behavior for Guacamole database integration are undefined.\nApproach: Request concrete use cases, supported Guacamole version/schema, auth and security constraints, and desired UI/workflow before estimating implementation.\nAI triage (codex): The issue is a high-level request with no technical scope, schema details, security requirements, or UX expectations, so implementation cannot be planned responsibly yet.\nApproach: Ask for concrete requirements (Guacamole version, database objects to read/write, sync behavior, credential/encryption rules, and UI flow), then produce a design proposal and implementation plan.\nAI triage (codex): The issue lacks any body or acceptance criteria, so the required Guacamole database integration scope cannot be determined.\nApproach: Ask for target Guacamole version, required CRUD/sync behaviors, authentication details, and expected UI workflow before proposing implementation.\nAI triage (codex): The issue body is empty and provides no requirements, use case, or acceptance criteria to define a workable implementation.\nApproach: Request concrete scope first: import vs sync behavior, supported Guacamole DB engines/schema versions, security/auth expectations, and desired UI workflow.\nAI triage (codex): The issue only states a broad integration request without requirements, schema details, or acceptance criteria needed to scope implementation.\nApproach: Ask for concrete use cases, supported Guacamole DB/version details, integration mode (import/export/live sync), and security/auth constraints before designing the feature.\nAI triage (codex): The issue body and comments are empty, so there is not enough information to define scope or implementation work.\nApproach: Ask the reporter for detailed Guacamole integration requirements, database versions, desired workflows, and acceptance criteria before triaging for implementation."
