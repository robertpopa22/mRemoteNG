I suggest to improve this functionality in this way:\r\n\r\n- When the \"Show only\" option is ON in the configuration, the button \"VIEW ONLY\" in the pannel will change to the real state (at time, it has the default initialization state).\r\n- After that, if the user changes the state of the button, a modal window will appear with this message: \"This session is View ...",
