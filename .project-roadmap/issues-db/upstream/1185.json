So, instead of having to connect/disconnect from all/one in a folder, shift+LClick, or Ctrl+LClick, so you have a range/partial list of servers, then right click as you normally would (connect/disconnect/etc menu pops up), and then it only does the task based on what is selected/highlighted.\r\n\r\nAny chance we could get this, please? :)",
