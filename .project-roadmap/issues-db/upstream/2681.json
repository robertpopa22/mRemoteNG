If I have dotnet installed, I\u0027d like a smaller installer.\n\nI am looking after release candidate to rework how bundle is assembled so thinking to add updater tool what could do check for new versions and download only new ones, as well where is always in release a zip package with all new files so if you need deploy you could just copy paste without installer at all and it will work.
