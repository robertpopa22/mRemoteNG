My suggestion is to have these two combined into a single view, similarly to a file manager. On the left side you would have the connections and on the right side you would see the configuration details of the currently selected connection. Please see mock-up belowΓÇª\n\n![image 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/...",
