If password is expired I have an error during connection 3847, so only solution is to use windows remote desktop client to change password first then again I can use MremoteNG.\r\n\r\n* Version used:\r\n* Operating System and version (e.g. Windows 10 1709 x64):\r\n",

Now if the password is expired, you can add these 2 lines to .rdp file:\n```\nauthentication level:i:2\nenablecredsspsupport:i:0\n```\nThen the mstsc.exe will open the connection with a prompt to change the password.",
