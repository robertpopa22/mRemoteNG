This is how it is working in the master branch. \r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nThe expected behaviour has changed in the develop branch, probably unintentionally, Putty does not get the focus anymore and the user needs an additional click every time.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nThe ConnectionTab looks less fancy in the master branch, so I assume there was some kind of...",
