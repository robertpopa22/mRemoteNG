I still have the focus issue with the latest nightly (20220613).\r\n\r\nWhen you use mRemoteNG with KiTTY and the window is out of focus, every output that gets send is blank when you switch focus back. Only the cursor is a the correct position. There is little that can be done to show the output. If there is a scrollbar you can scroll to show the blank region. Sometimes, after a few minutes, the characters appear.\r\n\r\nThis is very annoying.\r\n",
