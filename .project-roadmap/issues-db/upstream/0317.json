It\u0027s quite difficult to find on google, but it\u0027s very complete and works nicely.\r\n\r\nThis feature request is very old, as I found it in a 2010 post in your old forum: http://forum.mremoteng.org/viewtopic.php?f=4\u0026t=95 so maybe it has already been implemented but I couldn\u0027t find it.\r\nThe function should be quite simple: in addition to select \u0027Yes\u0027 or \u0027No\u0027 to \u0027Disk Drives\u0027 in \u0027Redirect\u0027 connection config menu, it would be nice to select which d...",

Not being able to select only some drives was the first thing I noticed.  I\u0027m a network administrator.  I have tons of network drives.  When I RDP into servers on my own network, I already have those same drives present on the host server (auto-mapped via Group Policy).  The only other drive I want to connect back to is my local C drive (\\\\tsclient\\c).  I could turn of all d...",

If I\u0027m connecting to a low bandwidth remote site I find myself reverting back to running RDP directly so I can limit to only one drive being shared.  I find Explorer to be quite slow when you have a lot of drives redirected and the connection is slow.\r\n\r\nBTW - Thanks for keeping this project alive.  I\u0027ve been a fan since mRemote.",
