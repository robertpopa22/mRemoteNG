It's quite difficult to find on google, but it's very complete and works nicely.\r\n\r\nThis feature request is very old, as I found it in a 2010 post in your old forum: http://forum.mremoteng.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=95 so maybe it has already been implemented but I couldn't find it.\r\nThe function should be quite simple: in addition to select 'Yes' or 'No' to 'Disk Drives' in 'Redirect' connection config menu, it would be nice to select which d...",

Not being able to select only some drives was the first thing I noticed.  I'm a network administrator.  I have tons of network drives.  When I RDP into servers on my own network, I already have those same drives present on the host server (auto-mapped via Group Policy).

If I'm connecting to a low bandwidth remote site I find myself reverting back to running RDP directly so I can limit to only one drive being shared.
