Create new *MenuItem resources for Options, ExternalTools, PortScan, SshFileTransfer, UltraVNCSingleClick. Update ConnectionContextMenu.cs and ToolsMenu.cs to use these new resources or updated strings.\nAI triage (claude): Two menu items (About, Keyboard Shortcuts) open dialogs but are missing the standard '...' ellipsis suffix convention.\nApproach: Add '...' suffix to 'Keyboard Shortcuts' text in HelpMenu.cs (hardcoded) and update 'About' text in Language.resx MenuItem_About resource from 'About' to 'About...'"
