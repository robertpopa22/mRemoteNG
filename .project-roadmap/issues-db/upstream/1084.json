Folder (container) should contain all options which might be inherited by child.\r\n2. By default child should inherit all options from parent.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n1.

We just hide properties that aren\u0027t supported for the currently selected protocol. It wouldn\u0027t hurt anything to just show all properties for folders.\r\n1.
