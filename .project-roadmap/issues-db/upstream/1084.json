Folder (container) should contain all options which might be inherited by child.\r\n2. By default child should inherit all options from parent.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n1.

We just hide properties that aren't supported for the currently selected protocol. It wouldn't hurt anything to just show all properties for folders.\r\n1. You can set the default inheritance values for new connections by first clicking the `Connections` root node, then clicking the `Default Inheritance` button in the config panel.\r\n![image](https://user-images....",

It took me a few minutes to get over your wording in order to give your feedback a fair reading and assessment. Titling it 'Inheritance hard to understand' or 'Inheritance defaults dont make sense' or something similar would be fair, but 'mess' comes off as harsh.",
