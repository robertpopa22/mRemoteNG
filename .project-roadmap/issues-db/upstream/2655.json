The only thing I see is that the tab always takes the name of the saved session and not the full name of the server. \r\nOn the putty side, everything is set up correctly and I have also checked the versions but have not been able to get the desired setting.\r\n...",

If you think that in the enterprise environment many ssh sessions necessarily start from a bastion host which allows you to reach all servers. \r\nWith this mode you realise that all connections would have a tab with the name of the bastion host and not that of the server you are working on, and you would not even have to manage the manual rename of the tabs, which would just be a waste of time in my opinion.\r\nHowever, mine is just...",
