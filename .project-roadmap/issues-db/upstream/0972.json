It would be useful to be able to paste these passwords into the logon dialog, lock screen and change password dialog, none of which support the paste operation (due to the clipboard process being a private user-process not available before login). \r\n\r\nIf mRemoteNG had a \"type clipboard text\" function (like TeamViewer) it would make logging in and changing passwor...",

In your case, the password is already stored, so a dedicated \"Type stored password\" would be very useful for lock screens (activated every 5 mins on my customer\u0027s servers!) as well as the \u0027change password\u0027 screen - neither of which allow the clipboard.
