This is problematic because an attacker could export a code-executing connection and then trick someone into importing and clicking on it, allowing the attacker to execute code on their machine. The root of the issue is this piece of code that is used for making PowerShell connections:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29503289/162325436-c75e93dc-7ab3-4e49-b30d-4ccf73dc...",
