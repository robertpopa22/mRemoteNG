If a user fully encrypts their connections file, then a custom password will also be required.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the default is to use a hard coded default password unless the user specifies a different one. This makes decryption trivial and is poor practice.\r\n\r\nRelated to #306 \r\nRelated to #208 ",
