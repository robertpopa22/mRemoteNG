This behaviour is strange. The default panel name should be language independend. Otherwise you will have to rename the panel name of all sessions. \r\n\r\nIf the team you are sharing session configurations is using different system languages this is a bad default behaviour. \r\n\r\n|--:|---|\r\n|Operating system | Windows 10 x64 |\r\n|mRemoteNG versi...",
