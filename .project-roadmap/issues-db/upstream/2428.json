Normal users should never require write permissions in program folders.\r\n\r\nAffected: The current nightly, 1.77.3 1784",

With issue #2256 a workaround with installing WebView2 for MS Edge (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) was documented which then remediates the need of changing the folder permissions, but I am with you that this is a design or documentation issue that needs to be addressed. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\nSimon",
