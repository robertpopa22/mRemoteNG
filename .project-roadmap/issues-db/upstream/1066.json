It's implemented simply by changing font size. Or...",

That's what I want to show.\r\n\r\n> If you have an RDP connection opened, should it be zoomed?\r\n\r\nGood question, I never used RDP, but I think it shouldn't be zoomed. If I demo something with RDP and it's too small to see I'd better use the native tools on the remote desktop to make them bigger. ",
