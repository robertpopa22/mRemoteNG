On next login same credentials will not work if password or user name (or both) has been changed :)\r\n\r\n",

The database would dynamically update the settings everywhere without the need of downloading config files on startup. I see this kind of distribution with proxy configurations and IMHO it's quite a pain to maintain...\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the ability to import connections with a double click would be great, maybe also allowing for one-time use (like...",
