  "body_snippet": "I love SmartSize. I come form using a VNC client where I scaled the remote to 80% so I can see it all on my client screen. I can't see a scale option in mRemoteNG, but I do see SmartSize and it does the job for me, in that I can see the whole of both remote screens. I have two problems with it:\r\n\r\n1) It doesn't preserve the aspect ratio, which well, is handy for quick checks on stuff, but not a working mode for me.\r\n\r\n2) Because it forces a larger net workspace (on my report machine) into a smal...",

Adding a 'SmartSize (Aspect)' option to RDPResolutions allows maintaining the aspect ratio (via letterboxing) by dynamically resizing the RDP control.\nApproach: Add `SmartSizeAspect` to `RDPResolutions`; update `RdpExtensions` to handle the new value; update `RdpProtocol` to handle this resolution by enabling SmartSizing and attaching a resize handler to maintain aspect ratio."
