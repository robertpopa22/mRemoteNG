Typically, when sensitive data (such as a password) is required, it is provided via a replacement parameter to the external app. So in the arguments text you might have `/p:%PASSWORD%`. Then, you can run that external app from a connection you define in your connection tree. This takes the password set in the connection (which is saved securely) and provides it to the external app.\r\n\r\nIf you have a use case where this does not work, or for some reaso...",
