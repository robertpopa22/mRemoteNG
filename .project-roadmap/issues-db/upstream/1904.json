    "body_snippet":  "This request is to integrate LAPS (Microsoft\u0027s Local Administrator Password Solution) as an access method, dynamically providing login credentials for administrative access to Windows hosts. This would be a useful and secure method to support administrative access in shops that utilize LAPS. Usage will require that the operator (admin) has appropriate access via domain policy and since LAPS is constantly changing the password, the risk of decrypting stored passwords is minimized.\r\n\r\n## Expected ...",

LAPS is designed to also support environments with the \"Administrator\" account disabled and an alternate designated local account used. I believe it is still a recommended best practice to disable the \"Administrator\" account and use a less common name in its place.",
