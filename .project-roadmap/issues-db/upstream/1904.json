  "body_snippet": "This request is to integrate LAPS (Microsoft's Local Administrator Password Solution) as an access method, dynamically providing login credentials for administrative access to Windows hosts. This would be a useful and secure method to support administrative access in shops that utilize LAPS. Usage will require that the operator (admin) has appropriate access via domain policy and since LAPS is constantly changing the password, the risk of decrypting stored passwords is minimized.\r\n\r\n## Expected ...",
