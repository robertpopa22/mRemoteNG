    "body_snippet":  "Hello,\r\nI discovered mRemoteNG, and I must say that I am very satisfied with this application.\r\nUnder linux I was using a \"multi ssh\" application which allowed me to launch an ssh session on several servers.\r\nThe display allowed to see all the servers as a grid. And it was possible to launch a command on all the displayed servers simultaneously.\r\nHow is this possible with mRemoteNG?\r\nI would like to be able to create a \"new connection\" with a list of servers. \r\nWhen clicking on this new connecti...",

What you can do is arrange the windows by drag and drop so you have multiple connections next to each other. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to use the multi-input feature, you will have to use the windows version of multissh (https://multissh.dev/). \r\nThen if you\u0027d like to use it with mRemoteNG you can add a new website pointing to the multissh service (http://127.0.0.1:12321) and you\u0027re ready to go. \r\n",
