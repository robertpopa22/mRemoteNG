  "notes": "AI triage (codex): The issue contains only a title with no body or comments, so the enhancement requirements are too vague to implement reliably.\nApproach: Ask for specific logon database-selection behavior (UI location, default choice, persistence rules, and error handling) before implementation planning.\nAI triage (gemini): Feasible enhancement to allow selecting database environment on startup. Can be implemented by adding a new setting and injecting a selection dialog (reusing existing SQL config UI) into the startup sequence.\nApproach: 1. Add `ShowDatabasePickerOnStartup` setting to OptionsDBsPage. 2. Update `SqlServerPage` UI to include a checkbox for this setting. 3. Create a new form `FrmPickDatabase` that hosts an instance of `SqlServerPage` (or similar controls) to allow modifying DB settings. 4. In `Runtime.LoadConnections`, check the new setting and if enabled, show `FrmPickDatabase` before attempting to load connections."
