    "body_snippet":  "\u003c!-- Bug --\u003e\r\nWhen you right click on a connection tab to bring up the context menu, clicking within the RDP frame does not dismiss the menu. Since all input is passed through to the RDP session, mRemoteNG\u0027s GUI doesn\u0027t understand I\u0027ve clicked elsewhere and the menu  is not dismissed. I tend to do this a lot, and the menu gets in my way which forces me to stop what I\u0027m doing in my remote session and click somewhere in the mRemoteNG GUI to dismiss it. \r\n\r\nThis is minor, so if it\u0027s an easy fix, go...",
