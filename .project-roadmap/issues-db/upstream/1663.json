This gets extremelly annoying when using a touch screen because it appears and gets in the way every time I touch the screen. It\u0027s not fit for purpose for me without this option.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\u003c!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in --\u003e\r\n*...",
