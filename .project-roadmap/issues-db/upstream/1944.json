It\u0027s attached.\r\nIt\u0027s not every time I launch it, but I can\u0027t quite figure out why it does it. It does more often than not.\r\nI need to end-task the program, then when I try to re-open it works just fine.\r\n\r\n![mremoteng](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50890638/111637559-eaab3180-87cf-11eb-9348-10374e4f385c.png)\r\n",
