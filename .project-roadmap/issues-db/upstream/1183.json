The issue is whenever I open mRemote and immediately start typing or clicking a connection/folder, the item that I just selected is no longer selected about 3 seconds after opening mRemote. Afterwards the \"Connections\"(globe icon) is selected and highlighted in my directory, as if I never touched anything. I've tested this issue with an expa...",

  "notes": "AI triage (gemini): The issue involves the UI selection state being reset or lost during the application startup sequence, likely due to a race condition between UI rendering and background loading/refreshing of the connection tree.\nApproach: Investigate the startup lifecycle events (Load, Shown) in FrmMain and the data loading process in ConnectionTree. Identify where the selection is being cleared or overwritten (e.g., by a late 'Clear' call or a delayed data binding event). Implement a fix to preserve the user's selection or defer the selection restoration until the tree is fully initialized and stable."
