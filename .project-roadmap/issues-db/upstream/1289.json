But does it store all credential records individually or can you have user/password pairs that are selectable?\r\n\r\nFor example, if I use the super secure combination of \"user\" and \"password\" across 5 hosts, would I have 5 separate records tied to each of the 5 hosts, or 1 credential record that is used by all 5 hosts?\r\n\r\nIf it\u0027s the later, then there would need to be some adjustments...",
