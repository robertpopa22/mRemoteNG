However my list is starting to get long and visually it would be great if I could somehow have them grouped.\r\n\r\nMy thought is being able to create folders for External Tools to \u0027categorize\u0027 them. Then I could have my PowerShell Scripts in one, Windows actions in another, SCCM actions in another etc., then when I goto External Tools I won\u0027t have to scroll through a list of items.

Very similar to how you can edit the shell in the Registry of Windows to create custom context menu items when you right-click on the Windows desktop.\r\n\r\nThis may be a request specific to my needs though and the way I\u0027m using the tool,...",

You can place external tools within folders and nest them however you would like or...\r\n1. Limit it to one folder deep and then we could just have an assignable \"Category\" property on each external tool. Each \"Category\" would then become a folder and tools without a category set would not be in a folder.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I would lean toward the second option.",
