I set the screen resolution in the application - it works.\r\nIs it possible to increase the size of text and other elements (scale)? For example, 125%. \r\nTo make the picture of the remote machine larger at the same resolution?\r\nIt is written in the parameters that the display parameters cannot be changed during a remote session.\r\nCan it be somehow possible to set this scale in the mRemoteNG application, or using the registry? ...",

If set to a specific value (100, 125, 150, 200), return that value. Only fall back to the calculated local resolution scaling (ResolutionScalingFactor.Width * 100) when the setting is Auto."
