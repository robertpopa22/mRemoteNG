My guess is they just lie to the server about which protocol version they will use. They tell the server they support protocol 4.0 or something to get through the connection handshake then just use 3.8 in the background. Would be interesting to know if Vncsharp (the library we use) could do the same thing.\r\n\r\n@kmscode thoughts?",
