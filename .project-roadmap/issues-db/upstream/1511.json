  "notes": "AI triage (claude): Users with large AD-imported trees need search to find connections inside collapsed folders without manually expanding all nodes first\nApproach: Ensure the TreeListView filter traverses all children recursively (even collapsed branches) when filtering. The ObjectListView TreeListView already walks the model tree for filtering — verify CanExpandGetter and the model enumeration include collapsed nodes. If not, override the filtering to flatten and search all descendants, then show matching items with their parent chain expanded."
