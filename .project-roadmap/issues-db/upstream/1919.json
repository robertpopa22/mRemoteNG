I use the hostname, possibly with the subdomain, as the name (name: hostname.dev) in most cases. Today I thought \"gee, it would be swell if I could use a variable to reference the connection name as part of the hostname, because then I could inherit that too and only modify a single field when duplicating to make a new connection!\" \r\n\r\nI found that external tools can reference s...",

It would make managing host entries a charm. Currently I need to edit every single display name AND hostname when just duplicating an existing entry for a new host and either (1) repeating the whole FQDN when the option \"Set hostname like the display name\" is set or (2) change the hostname together with the displa...",
