Sometimes I use 1920 x 1080, that is probably pushing things a bit, but it is workable and the \"extra space\" is very convenient.\r\n\r\nIt really depends on the screen you are physically working on, which is why I suggested separating the field into 2 separate fields.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, this client has more than 1 connection target to consider so that might be tricky to...",
