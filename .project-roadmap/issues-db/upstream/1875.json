  "notes": "AI triage (gemini): Reconnection of SSH sessions fails when the connection window is in a floating state, suggesting a bug in how ConnectionWindow re-initializes or re-associates the underlying SSH protocol handler upon reconnection.\nApproach: Investigate the `Reconnect()` method in `ConnectionWindow.cs` to ensure that it properly disposes of the old SSH protocol object and creates a new one, or re-establishes the connection for the existing one, when called on a floating window. This might involve checking the lifecycle of the `ProtocolBase` or `PuttyBase` instance associated with the `ConnectionWindow` when it's floating versus docked. Special attention should be paid to how floating windows are managed and how their connection state is preserved or restored during reconnection."
