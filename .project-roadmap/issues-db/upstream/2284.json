If I am correct, this should open it in a tab instead of a window that got opened.\r\n\r\nGenerally I am on your side that mRemoteNG should support the WSL connection natively, but I don\u0027t get why one should use a wrapper like pterm when it could be done natively. And when we are talking about Terminals, Microsoft has a great one as well: https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701\r\n\r\nRegards",
