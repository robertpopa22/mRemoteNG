That popup steals focus and is annoying when multiple sessions are open which then starts closing after some time.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this originates from PuTTy so not really a mRemote issue but could there be some \"hacky\" way of either suppressing this popup (auto-confirming it silently) or if the \"Close window on exit\" is enabled on PuTTy then somehow retain the connection tab in mRemote with sess...",
