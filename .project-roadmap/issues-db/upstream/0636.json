  "notes": "AI triage: VNC connection attempts to unavailable hosts block the UI thread for ~3 minutes due to synchronous socket connect without a reasonable timeout\nApproach: Add a short connection timeout (e.g. 5-10 seconds) to the VNC protocol handler so that unreachable hosts fail fast instead of blocking the application for the full TCP default timeout. Ensure the connection attempt runs asynchronously or with a cancellation token to keep the UI responsive."
