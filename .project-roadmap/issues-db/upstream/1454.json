  "notes": "AI triage (claude): Ben.Demystifier would improve stack trace readability in error logging across ~48 files, useful for support diagnostics but low priority nice-to-have.\nApproach: Add Ben.Demystifier NuGet package and call .Demystify() on exceptions in the central error handling paths (ProgramRoot unhandled exception handler, FrmUnhandledException, MessageCollector) rather than modifying all 48 files — the package works by extension method on Exception objects at the point of display/logging."
