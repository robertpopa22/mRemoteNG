The menu item is called \"Send Special Keys (RDP)\".\r\nAt present the options are Ctrl-Alt-Del and Ctrl-Esc.\r\nIs it possible to be able to add an extra item for sending the Windows Key?\r\n\r\nThis will be useful as the Server I'm using has a hidden taskbar. Its tricky to get to the taskbar in a RDP environment when hidden.\r\n...",
