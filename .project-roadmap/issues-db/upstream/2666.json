A lot of options can be _only_ tested loading a _large_ configuration. This limitation is therefore a major constraint.\n\nSo, please rethink it!\n",

I don't have an issue running unstable software as long as I can work efficiently with it, but being unable to export config changes and having to redo them with an old version of the application is too much of a burden. \n\nBut a note for completeness: The new Builds 1.77.3+-NB and (expected - not yet tested) 1.78.1-...",

Also, it's a good decision to provide forward compatibility with the next release version.\n\nHowerver, please (with all respect) stop to say that users don't understand what is a NB release. I'm using for years the **portable NB version 1.77.3** (https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/releases/download/v1.77.3-nb/Portable.-.1.77.3.NB.rar) because it works, it save...",
