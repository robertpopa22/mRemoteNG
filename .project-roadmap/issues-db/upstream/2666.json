A lot of options can be _only_ tested loading a _large_ configuration. This limitation is therefore a major constraint.\n\nSo, please rethink it!\n",

I don\u0027t have an issue running unstable software as long as I can work efficiently with it, but being unable to export config changes and having to redo them with an old version of the application is too much of a burden. \n\nBut a note for completeness: The new Builds 1.77.3+-NB and (expected - not yet tested) 1.78.1-...",
