  "body_snippet": "Hi everyone.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to completely encrypt connection file, it stays fully encrypted until you open it in a new version of the application. It makes a backup copy of the current file (where content is still encrypted) and after closing app, it saves connection file in decrypted condition (Yes passwords stay in some form of hash,  but everything else is visible).\r\nThe same behavior for 1.76.15 and 1.76.11 and so on.\r\nIt can be fixed by choosing again to completely encrypt connection file...",

If you do not copy the settings file over to the new directory, the setting for encrypting the entire connection file will not be enabled in your new version of the app. (I believe that is what is happening here, but please correct me if I'm wrong.)\r\n\r\nThat being said, I agree that this is an issue. The solution would be to manage the \"full encryption\" setting within the connection file itself, rather than making it a global app...",
