Right click on the same connection\r\n2. Click on \"Connect (with options)\"\r\n3. Click on \"Select Panel before connecting\"\r\n4. Select panel and press ok\r\n\r\nIMHO it will be a good trick to use something like ctrl+doubleclick, or alt+doubleclick to do the same but with less steps ;-)\r\n\r\nThx for take the old mRemote and maintaining it alive. Regards,",
