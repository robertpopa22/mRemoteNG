XC is a fork from X that looks good but misses a lot of functionality and it was originally planned for MacOS iirc. KeePass 2 is robust, actively maintained, has tons of options, plugins, etc. If you see people speaking about just KeePass, this means the version from Dominik.\r\nI really hope this will be implemented some day. Thanks to all the developers for the excellent work. ",

So for example my URL is ssh://10.10.10.10, I have configured an URL Override, which will translate this to \"cmd://PuTTY.exe -ssh {USERNAME}@10.10.10.10 -pw {PASSWORD}\" --\u003e Basically KeePass opens a SSH session with PuTTY from the command line.
