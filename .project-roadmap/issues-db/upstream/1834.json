But that is a payed tool where i cat save more than limited number of sessions.\r\nNow i am trying out ,mRemoteNG but the pain point that mRemoteNG has is a ftp side bar. This feature is very handy with linux machines where you can drag and drop files from and to the remote machine.\r\n\r\nAlso there is a monitoring bar down of the screen. It would be really handy also to have it.\r\n![mobaxterm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20978632/90394650-5343fb...",
