I also forward tcp5900 over my ssh session and connect to VNC on my home-linux machine. Normal operation would be that I can embed the VNC (java) client into mRemoteNG and work with that. \r\n\r\nThis all works perfectly except for the fact that I cannot use the keyboard in the embedded VNC session. Everything BUT embedded in mRemoteNG and the keyboard input...",
