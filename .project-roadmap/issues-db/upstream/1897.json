The current implementation only programmatically sets the default layout for the current session, but the old configuration is reloaded on the next launch.\nApproach: Modify the `mMenViewResetLayout_Click` method in `mRemoteNG\\UI\\Menu\\msMain\\ViewMenu.cs` to delete the `pnlLayout.xml` file (located at `SettingsFileInfo.SettingsPath\\SettingsFileInfo.LayoutFileName`) after user confirmation and before calling `MainForm?.SetDefaultLayout()`. This will ensure a clean slate for the default layout to be applied and correctly persisted.",
