Refactored logic in ConnectionInitiator.cs to correctly handle Force.NoCredentials.
When Force.NoCredentials is set:
1. The ConnectionInfo object is cloned to prevent modifying the persistent configuration.
2. The cloned object's Parent property is manually restored to connectionInfoOriginal.Parent. This is crucial because the standard Clone() method nulls the Parent to prevent accidental inheritance of parent properties during copy operations. However, for a runtime connection instance, we WANT inheritance to function for non-credential properties (like Protocol, Port, Colors, etc.).
3. Inheritance is explicitly disabled for Username, Password, and Domain on the cloned object.
4. Username, Password, and Domain are cleared (set to empty strings) on the cloned object.

This ensures that:
- The connection is established without credentials (as requested).
- The tab title (generated by AddConnectionTab) uses the empty username/domain from the clone, correctly suppressing the logon info display (e.g. showing "()" instead of "(user@domain)").
- Other inherited properties (like Protocol) are correctly resolved from the parent, preventing regressions where they would revert to defaults (e.g. RDP).
