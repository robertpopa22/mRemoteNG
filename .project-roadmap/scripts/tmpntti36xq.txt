Fix GitHub issue #1114: [Feature] Multi select / edit connections
Description: 
Approach: Update ConnectionTree to pass all selected nodes to ConfigWindow. Update ConfigWindow and ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid to accept a list of connections. Refactor property filtering logic in ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid to determine common properties and exclusions for the selected set, then use the underlying PropertyGrid.SelectedObjects.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionTree/ConnectionTree.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConfigWindow.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid/ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid.cs
