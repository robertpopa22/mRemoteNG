Fix GitHub issue #939: [Feature Request] Dynamic Connection Folder
Description: 
Approach: Extend `DynamicSourceType` enum with new sources (e.g., `Script`, `File`). Update `DynamicFolderManager.RefreshFolderInternal` to handle these new types by invoking the appropriate importer or script parser to populate `ContainerInfo.Children`.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Container/DynamicSourceType.cs, mRemoteNG/Container/DynamicFolderManager.cs, mRemoteNG/Container/ContainerInfo.cs

Do ONLY the fix. Nothing else.
