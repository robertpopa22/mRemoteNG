Fix GitHub issue #1192: Feature Request: Template connections with no hostnames
Description: 
Approach: 1. Add `IsTemplate` boolean property to `ConnectionInfo`. 2. Expose `IsTemplate` in `ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid`. 3. Modify `ConnectionInitiator.OpenConnection` to block connection attempts if `IsTemplate` is true (with a user-friendly message or silent return). 4. Update `StatusImageList` to show a distinct icon for template connections. 5. Verify inheritance still works correctly.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs, mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInitiator.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid/ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/StatusImageList.cs
