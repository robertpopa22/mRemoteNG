Fix GitHub issue #1121: [Feature] Quick Connect in CAPS
Description: 
Approach: Add a new boolean setting `QuickConnectForceUpperCase` in Settings. Add a checkbox to the Connections options page to toggle this setting. In `QuickConnectComboBox`, bind the inner ComboBox's `CharacterCasing` property to this setting (Upper vs Normal).
Likely files: mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/QuickConnectComboBox.cs, mRemoteNG/Properties/Settings.settings, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/OptionsPages/ConnectionsPage.cs
