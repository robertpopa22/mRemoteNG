Fix GitHub issue #1321: Simplify process to add new connection properties
Description: 
Approach: Refactor to use .NET Source Generators or a reflection-based property definition system to automatically generate the boilerplate code for properties, inheritance flags, and serialization logic from a single definition point.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/AbstractConnectionRecord.cs, mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfoInheritance.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializers/Xml/XmlConnectionNodeSerializer28.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializers/Xml/XmlConnectionsDeserializer.cs
