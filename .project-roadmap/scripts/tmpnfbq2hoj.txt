Fix GitHub issue #872: Enhancement - Security at the Folder Level
Description: 
Approach: Extend the ConnectionInfo class to support a security/lock state for containers. Implement a password prompt UI mechanism when expanding locked folders in the ConnectionTree. Investigate feasibility of encrypting the subtree in the XML storage vs UI-only locking.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs, mRemoteNG/Tree/ConnectionTreeModel.cs, mRemoteNG/Security/Security.cs
