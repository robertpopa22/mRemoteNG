Fix GitHub issue #2051: REQUEST: Support for connection presets

Description:


Recommended approach: Create a new ConnectionPreset class for defining reusable connection configurations. Implement XML serialization/deserialization for presets. Develop a ConnectionPresetService for managing presets. Design a new UI dialog for preset management and integrate the ability to apply presets within the connection properties editor.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionPreset.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializers/Xml/XmlConnectionPresetSerializer.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializers/Xml/XmlConnectionPresetDeserializer.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/ConnectionPresetService.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/FrmConnectionPresets.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/FrmConnection.cs

RULES (CRITICAL):
- Read code BEFORE modifying
- Do NOT change existing behavior — only fix the reported issue
- Do NOT create interactive tests (no dialogs, MessageBox, notepad.exe)
- Do NOT run git commit, git add, git push, or ANY git operations. The orchestrator handles all commits.
- NEVER modify these infrastructure files: run-tests.ps1, build.ps1, mRemoteNG.sln, Directory.Build.props, Directory.Packages.props, .github/workflows/*. They are READ-ONLY.
- After fixing, run build: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"
- After build passes, run tests: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild
- If YOUR change breaks tests, fix it.  If tests fail for unrelated reasons, ignore.
- Do ONLY the fix.  Nothing else.
