Fix GitHub issue #1028: Cannot use saved credentials
Description: 
Approach: 1. Add a 'CredentialRecordId' (Guid) property to AbstractConnectionRecord, decorated with CredentialRecordListAdaptor as its editor. 2. Update ConnectionInitiator to look up the credential record by ID and apply the username, password, and domain to the connection before connecting.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/AbstractConnectionRecord.cs, mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInitiator.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/Adapters/CredentialRecordListAdaptor.cs
