Fix GitHub issue #945: Feature Request - Multiselect when organizing connections

Description:


Recommended approach: Enable multi-selection in the connections tree and add bulk organize/edit actions using existing batched-save flows.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionTree/ConnectionTree.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionTreeWindow.cs, mRemoteNGTests/UI/Window/ConnectionTreeWindowTests.cs

RULES (CRITICAL):
- Read code BEFORE modifying
- Do NOT change existing behavior â€” only fix the reported issue
- Do NOT create interactive tests (no dialogs, MessageBox, notepad.exe)
- After fixing, run build: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"
- After build passes, run tests: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild
- If YOUR change breaks tests, fix it.  If tests fail for unrelated reasons, ignore.
- Do ONLY the fix.  Nothing else.
