Fix GitHub issue #1190: Support autenticate with private key without have too make an Putty Session
Description: 
Approach: Add a new PrivateKeyPath property to AbstractConnectionRecord with a custom file picker editor attribute. Update PuttyBase.Connect to check this property and append the '-i' argument to the PuTTY command line if a key file is specified.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/AbstractConnectionRecord.cs, mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/PuttyBase.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid/PrivateKeyFileEditor.cs
