Fix GitHub issue #1095: wrong logon information on tab shown when using "connect without credentials"
Description: 
Approach: Clone ConnectionInfo when Force.NoCredentials, disable credential inheritance, clear username/password/domain so tab shows empty () instead of saved credentials
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInitiator.cs
