Fix GitHub issue #875: Allow setting RDP AuthenticationLevel to prevent NLA error 2825

Description:


Recommended approach: Add an optional per-connection/default AuthenticationLevel setting, persist it, and apply it to the RDP control before connect with legacy-safe default behavior.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs, mRemoteNG/Protocols/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/ConnectionForm.cs

RULES (CRITICAL):
- Read code BEFORE modifying
- Do NOT change existing behavior â€” only fix the reported issue
- Do NOT create interactive tests (no dialogs, MessageBox, notepad.exe)
- After fixing, run build: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"
- After build passes, run tests: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild
- If YOUR change breaks tests, fix it.  If tests fail for unrelated reasons, ignore.
- Do ONLY the fix.  Nothing else.
