Fix GitHub issue #1262: Use native OpenSSH client on newer Windows 10
Description: 
Approach: Create a new `ProtocolOpenSSH` class inheriting from `ProtocolBase` that utilizes the `ConsoleControl` library to embed the native `ssh.exe` process. Map connection properties (hostname, username, port, private key) to OpenSSH command-line arguments and expose the new protocol in `ProtocolType` and `ProtocolFactory`.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/OpenSSH/Connection.Protocol.OpenSSH.cs, mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/ProtocolType.cs, mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/ProtocolFactory.cs
