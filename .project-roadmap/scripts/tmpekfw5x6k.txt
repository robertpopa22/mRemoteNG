Fix GitHub issue #1101: [Feature] Recently connected
Description: 
Approach: Extract recent connection tracking logic from JumpListManager into a shared service. Update ConnectionInitiator to register successful connections. Implement a 'Recently Connected' submenu in FileMenu and ensure JumpList is also updated.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/UI/Menu/msMain/FileMenu.cs, mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInitiator.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Taskbar/JumpListManager.cs
