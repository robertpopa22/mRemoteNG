Fix GitHub issue #1175: Select a custom resolution and set it to smart size also for RDP session
Description: 
Approach: Add 'SmartSizing' boolean property to ConnectionInfo and AbstractConnectionRecord. Update RdpProtocol.SetResolution to apply SmartSizing property to the RDP client. Update XML/SQL/CSV serializers and inheritance logic to persist the new property. Expose in UI.
