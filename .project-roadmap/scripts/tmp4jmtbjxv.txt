Fix GitHub issue #835: Automatically propagate inheritance

Description:


Recommended approach: Add an `Auto` option to the Inherit All UI and wire it to existing inheritance comparison logic so changed parent properties propagate automatically to children.
Likely files: mRemoteV1/Connection/ConnectionInfoInheritance.cs, mRemoteV1/UI/Forms/frmConnection.cs

RULES (CRITICAL):
- Read code BEFORE modifying
- Do NOT change existing behavior — only fix the reported issue
- Do NOT create interactive tests (no dialogs, MessageBox, notepad.exe)
- After fixing, run build: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"
- After build passes, run tests: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild
- If YOUR change breaks tests, fix it.  If tests fail for unrelated reasons, ignore.
- Do ONLY the fix.  Nothing else.
