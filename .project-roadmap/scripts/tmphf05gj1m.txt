Fix GitHub issue #1219: Disable detach panels
Description: 
Approach: Add a 'LockPanels' setting to TabsPanelsPage. When enabled, set 'AllowEndUserDocking = false' for all DockContent panels (Tree, Config, Errors, etc.). Update BaseWindow to respect this setting on initialization.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Properties/OptionsTabsPanelsPage.settings, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/OptionsPages/TabsPanelsPage.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Window/BaseWindow.cs

Do ONLY the fix. Nothing else.
