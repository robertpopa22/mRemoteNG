Fix GitHub issue #768: Add integration support for some common external apps

Description:


Recommended approach: Implement presets and launch handlers for common shell tools (pwsh, cmd, WSL) within the protocol integration layer and add corresponding tests.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/IntegratedProgram.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Settings/ExternalAppsLoader.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ExternalToolsWindow.cs, mRemoteNGTests/Connection/Protocol/IntegratedProgramTests.cs

RULES (CRITICAL):
- Read code BEFORE modifying
- Do NOT change existing behavior — only fix the reported issue
- Do NOT create interactive tests (no dialogs, MessageBox, notepad.exe)
- After fixing, run build: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"
- After build passes, run tests: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild
- If YOUR change breaks tests, fix it.  If tests fail for unrelated reasons, ignore.
- Do ONLY the fix.  Nothing else.
