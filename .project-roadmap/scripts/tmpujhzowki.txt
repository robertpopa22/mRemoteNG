Fix GitHub issue #1203: Menu bar placement
Description: 
Approach: Add MainMenuLocation and MainMenuParentDock properties to Settings. Update SettingsSaver.SaveSettings to persist the msMain position and SettingsLoader.LoadSettings (AddMainMenuPanel) to restore it, defaulting to 'Top' if not set.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Config/Settings/SettingsLoader.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Settings/SettingsSaver.cs, mRemoteNG/Properties/Settings.settings
