Fix GitHub issue #1031: Can't save ConfCons.xml
Description: 
Approach: 1. Update XmlConnectionsSaver to validate that the serialized XML string is not empty before writing to disk. 2. Update XmlConnectionNodeSerializer28 (and older versions if needed) to null-coalesce all string properties (e.g., PuttySession ?? "") to prevent ArgumentNullException.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Config/Connections/XmlConnectionsSaver.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializers/Xml/XmlConnectionNodeSerializer28.cs
