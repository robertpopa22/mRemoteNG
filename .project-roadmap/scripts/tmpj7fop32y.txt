Fix GitHub issue #1095: wrong logon information on tab shown when using "connect without credentials"
Description: 
Approach: Modify ConnectionInitiator.cs to clone the connection object when Force.NoCredentials is active, restore the parent reference for non-credential inheritance, and explicitly clear credential fields to ensure the tab title reflects the 'no credentials' state.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInitiator.cs

Do ONLY the fix. Nothing else.
