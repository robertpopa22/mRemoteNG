Fix GitHub issue #835: Automatically propagate inheritance
Description: 
Approach: Add an `Auto` option to the Inherit All UI and wire it to existing inheritance comparison logic so changed parent properties propagate automatically to children.
Likely files: mRemoteV1/Connection/ConnectionInfoInheritance.cs, mRemoteV1/UI/Forms/frmConnection.cs

Review the current state of the code, correct any issues, and make the fix work.

RULES: Read code first. Do NOT change existing behavior. Run build.ps1 then run-tests.ps1 -NoBuild.
Do ONLY the fix. Nothing else.
