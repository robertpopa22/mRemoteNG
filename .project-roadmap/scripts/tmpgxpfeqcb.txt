Fix GitHub issue #1197: Scaling the size of text, applications and other elements 125% on a remote machine.
Description: 
Approach: Add a `DesktopScaleFactor` property (e.g. Auto, 100, 125, 150, 200) to `ConnectionInfo`. Update `RdpProtocol.SetResolution` to use this value for the RDP `DesktopScaleFactor` extended property, falling back to local DPI only if set to Auto.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs, mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid/ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid.cs
