Implemented issue `#984` with a new linked-connection flow, while keeping existing duplicate behavior unchanged.

**What changed**
- Added linked metadata and runtime resolution:
  - `mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs`
  - `mRemoteNG/Tree/ConnectionTreeModel.cs`
- Added a new tree action to create links:
  - `mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionTree/ConnectionTree.cs`
- Added context-menu entry `Create Link` (connection nodes only):
  - `mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionContextMenu.cs`
- Persisted link reference in XML:
  - `mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializers/Xml/XmlConnectionNodeSerializer28.cs`
  - `mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializers/Xml/XmlConnectionsDeserializer.cs`
  - `mRemoteNG/Schemas/mremoteng_confcons_v2_8.xsd`

**Behavior**
- `Duplicate` still duplicates as before.
- New `Create Link` creates a new node that stores `LinkedConnectionId` and resolves shared settings from the source connection at runtime.

**Tests added/updated**
- `mRemoteNGTests/Tree/ConnectionTreeModelTests.cs`
- `mRemoteNGTests/UI/Controls/ConnectionTreeTests.cs`
- `mRemoteNGTests/Connection/ConnectionInfoTests.cs`
- `mRemoteNGTests/IntegrationTests/XmlSerializationLifeCycleTests.cs`

**Build/Test execution**
I attempted the exact required commands, but command execution is blocked by policy in this environment:

- `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"`
- `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild"`

Both returned: `rejected: blocked by policy`.

1. Run those two commands in your normal local shell (without this policy restriction) to validate compile/tests.
