Fix GitHub issue #1099: Saving password in internal browser
Description: 
Approach: Add a 'BrowserPersistence' property to ConnectionInfo. When enabled, configure WebView2 to use a stable user data folder (e.g., in AppData based on Connection GUID) and prevent its deletion on connection close.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs, mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/Http/Connection.Protocol.HTTPBase.cs
