Fix GitHub issue #1137: export and import with encryption
Description: 
Approach: Update FrmExport to allow setting an encryption password. Modify Export.cs to use the provided password. Update MRemoteNGXmlImporter to supply an authentication callback to the deserializer to handle encrypted imports.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/App/Export.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Import/MRemoteNGXmlImporter.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/FrmExport.cs
