Fix GitHub issue #984: Create link to connection instead of duplicating?
Description: 
Approach: Introduce a linked-connection entry that stores a reference to a source connection and resolves shared settings at runtime instead of copying values.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Tree/ConnectionTreeModel.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/frmMain.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializer.cs

IMPORTANT â€” Previous agents already attempted this fix.
Their changes may still be in the working tree.

Currently I have a \"_Quick\" folder and a bunch of duplicated connections. It works fine but when I need to update the connection configurations, I have to update both the original one and the duplicated one. It would be nice if I can create a link to a connection.\r\nThanks!",

Review the current state of the code, correct any issues, and make the fix work.

RULES: Read code first. Do NOT change existing behavior. Run build.ps1 then run-tests.ps1 -NoBuild.
Do ONLY the fix. Nothing else.
