Fix GitHub issue #969: Request import bookmarks.html and right-click properties
Description: 
Approach: Create a new `BookmarksHtmlImporter` class implementing `IConnectionImporter` to parse Netscape Bookmark HTML files. Update `mRemoteNG/App/Import.cs` to register the `.html` extension and potentially add a specific menu item if needed. The importer will map bookmark folders to mRemoteNG folders and URLs to HTTP/HTTPS connections (or other protocols if scheme is present).
Likely files: mRemoteNG/App/Import.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Import/BookmarksHtmlImporter.cs, mRemoteNG/Resources/Language/Language.resx
