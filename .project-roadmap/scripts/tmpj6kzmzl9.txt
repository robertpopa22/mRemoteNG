Fix GitHub issue #1696: TightVNC closes gracefully using mRemoteNG
Description: 
Approach: Investigate the `VNCEvent_Disconnected` handler and other event subscriptions in `mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/VNC/Connection.Protocol.VNC.cs` to understand why `VncSharpCore.RemoteDesktop` might be disconnecting unexpectedly. This may involve adding detailed logging around `VncSharpCore` events to identify the trigger for these 'graceful' closures.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/VNC/Connection.Protocol.VNC.cs
