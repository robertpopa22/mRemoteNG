Fix GitHub issue #1065: UI: Some menu items that open a dialog are missing "..." on the menu item

Description:


Recommended approach: Add '...' suffix to 4 menu item texts that open dialogs: 'Keyboard Shortcuts' and 'About' in HelpMenu.cs, 'Find in Session' in ToolsMenu.cs, and 'Properties' in ConnectionContextMenu.cs. Update both Initialize() and ApplyLanguage() methods in each file.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/UI/Menu/msMain/HelpMenu.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Menu/msMain/ToolsMenu.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionContextMenu.cs

RULES (CRITICAL):
- Read code BEFORE modifying
- Do NOT change existing behavior — only fix the reported issue
- Do NOT create interactive tests (no dialogs, MessageBox, notepad.exe)
- After fixing, run build: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"
- After build passes, run tests: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild
- If YOUR change breaks tests, fix it.  If tests fail for unrelated reasons, ignore.
- Do ONLY the fix.  Nothing else.
