Fix GitHub issue #1128: Connection tree flickers & hourglass cursor when using with multiple users on one SQL database
Description: 
Approach: Modify SqlConnectionsUpdateChecker to detect specific changes or implement a diff-based update mechanism to avoid full tree reloads. Optimize the update frequency or move the heavy lifting off the UI thread completely, ensuring the UI is only updated when necessary and without blocking.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Config/Connections/Multiuser/SqlConnectionsUpdateChecker.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Connections/Multiuser/RemoteConnectionsSyncronizer.cs, mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionsService.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionTreeWindow.cs
