Fix GitHub issue #1127: Middle-clicking panel tab to close specific panel closes all open panels
Description: 
Approach: Investigate `MiddleClickCloseTab` and `QueueCloseTab` in `DockPaneStripNG.cs` to ensure `TryCloseTab` is called strictly for the target content and does not trigger a pane-level close event.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/UI/Tabs/DockPaneStripNG.cs
