Implemented the issue fix for moving open tabs between connection panels.

### What changed

- Added a **tab context-menu action** (`Send To`) that lists existing connection panels and moves the selected tab to the chosen panel:
  - `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs:147`
  - `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs:258`
  - `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs:309`

- Added **cross-panel drag/drop handling** on connection panel docks and tab strips:
  - Registers drag/drop targets on `connDock` and `DockPaneStripNG` controls:
    - `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs:180`
    - `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs:194`
  - Accepts dragged `ConnectionTab` only from a different connection panel and moves it:
    - `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs:225`
    - `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs:237`

- Added **drag initiation from tab strip** when dragging a connection tab out of its strip (without changing normal in-strip reorder behavior):
  - `mRemoteNG/UI/Tabs/DockPaneStripNG.cs:94`
  - `mRemoteNG/UI/Tabs/DockPaneStripNG.cs:1116`
  - `mRemoteNG/UI/Tabs/DockPaneStripNG.cs:1139`
  - `mRemoteNG/UI/Tabs/DockPaneStripNG.cs:1193`

- Preserved expected behavior on move:
  - Updates panel assignment on `Info`, `OriginalInfo`, and tracked connection metadata:
    - `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs:378`
  - Rebinds tab context menu to the target panel, activates/focuses moved tab, and closes source panel if empty:
    - `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs:319`
    - `mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs:343`

### Verification status

I attempted to run the required commands exactly as requested, but script execution is blocked by this environment policy:

1. `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"` → blocked by policy  
2. `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild` → blocked by policy

No other behavioral areas were intentionally changed.
