Fix GitHub issue #1059: Windows 10 High Contrast (green on black) theme clashes with default mRemoteNG theme, for connection tabs
Description: 
Approach: Detect `SystemInformation.HighContrast` on startup and `UserPreferenceChanged`. If active, override the default DockPanel theme (likely VS2015) with a system-compatible theme (e.g., VS2005 or native) that respects OS color settings.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/UI/Window/FrmMain.cs, mRemoteNG/App/ThemeManager.cs
