Fix GitHub issue #1268: Window layout broken if DPS deserialization throws exception
Description: 
Approach: Wrap the logic in LoadLayout with a try-catch block. In the catch block, log the exception and call _mainForm.SetDefaultLayout() to ensure the UI remains usable.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Config/Settings/DockPanelLayoutLoader.cs
