Fix GitHub issue #751: Add ODBC support

Description:


Recommended approach: Add an ODBC connector and wire it into provider selection, registry validation, and connection testing, then extend SQL connection integration coverage for the new provider path.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Config/DatabaseConnectors/DatabaseConnectorFactory.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/DatabaseConnectors/OdbcDatabaseConnector.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Settings/Registry/OptRegistrySqlServerPage.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/OptionsPages/SqlServerPage.cs, mRemoteNGTests/Config/Connections/SqlConnectionsLoaderIntegrationTests.cs

RULES (CRITICAL):
- Read code BEFORE modifying
- Do NOT change existing behavior — only fix the reported issue
- Do NOT create interactive tests (no dialogs, MessageBox, notepad.exe)
- After fixing, run build: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"
- After build passes, run tests: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild
- If YOUR change breaks tests, fix it.  If tests fail for unrelated reasons, ignore.
- Do ONLY the fix.  Nothing else.
