Fix GitHub issue #1097: Save and restore custom connection panel layout
Description: 
Approach: Refactor DockPanelLayoutLoader to accept a custom file path. Add 'Save Layout' and 'Load Layout' menu items to FrmMain that use FileDialogs to let the user choose a layout file, then invoke the loader/saver with that path.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Config/Settings/DockPanelLayoutLoader.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/FrmMain.cs
