The AddChildRange append logic is correct, so the bug is likely in the save/reload cycle between multiple file imports. Add a guard in ConnectionsService to prevent tree replacement during an active import batch, or ensure BatchedSavingContext properly accumulates all changes before a single atomic save.\"}\n```\n",
