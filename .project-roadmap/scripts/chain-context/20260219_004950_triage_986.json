This prevents the RDP session window from resizing when the mRemoteNG window is resized (breaking \"Smart Sizing\" and general layout). `RdpProtocol8` (RDP 8+) implements a manual resize workaround, but the default `RdpProtocol` (RDP < 8) lacks this, leading to the reported behavior.\n\nThe fix is to remove the `Control.Anchor = AnchorStyles.None;` line in `RdpProtocol.cs`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"implement\",\n  \"reason\": \"The RDP ActiveX control is explicitly set to Anchor=None during initialization, overriding Dock=Fill and preventing the session window from resizing with the application.
