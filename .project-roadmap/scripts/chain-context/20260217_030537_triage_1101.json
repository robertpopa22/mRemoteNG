This will involve creating a `RecentConnectionsService` to persist the list and updating `FileMenu` to display it, hooking into connection events to keep it current.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"The feature does not exist in the application UI (only in Taskbar JumpList and QuickConnect history).\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/UI/Menu/msMain/FileMenu.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Config/Settings/RecentConnectionsService.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/FrmMain.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Create a RecentConnectionsService to track and persist recent connections (similar to JumpListManager but for in-app use) and add a 'Recently Connected' submenu to the File menu.\"}\n```\n",
