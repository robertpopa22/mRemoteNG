My plan is to identify relevant files that would need modification for connection management, protocol handling, and configuration storage within the `mRemoteNG` directory, and then formulate the triage JSON.\n`mRemoteNG`'s `Connection` and `Config` subdirectories are confirmed as relevant, with `UI` also playing a role. I will now search for `ConnectionInfo` and `RDPProtocol` in `mRemoteNG/Connection` and `mRemoteNG/UI` to pinpoint specific files.\nI've identified core files for implementing bastion support: `ConnectionInfo.cs`, `RdpProtocol.cs`, `ProtocolFactory.cs`, and UI elements. My proposed triage JSON outlines these changes, prioritizing extending `ConnectionInfo` and adapting RDP protocol handling. I'll now confirm the correct UI form (likely `FrmConnection.cs`) for editing connection properties by searching for `ConnectionInfo` references within `mRemoteNG/UI/Forms`.\n`FrmConnectWithOptions.cs` is a strong candidate for bastion property editing in connection options due to its direct `ConnectionInfo` exposure and PropertyGrid usage. For *saved* connection properties, I'll investigate `mRemoteNG/UI/Forms` for a dedicated connection editing form like `FrmConnection.cs`, and list all files in that directory.\nI'll assume `FrmConnectWithOptions.cs` or a dynamic UI handles connection property editing, and will proceed with `ConnectionInfo.cs`, `RdpProtocol.cs`, and `ProtocolFactory.cs` as primary files. I'm adding `XmlConnectionNodeSerializer28.cs` for persistence. My refined triage JSON will reflect this, outlining the implementation of bastion support through extending `ConnectionInfo`, modifying the RDP protocol, updating the UI in `FrmConnectWithOptions.cs`, and ensuring persistence via `XmlConnectionNodeSerializer28.cs`.\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"implement\",\n  \"reason\": \"Adds support for connecting via bastion services to cloud instances, enhancing connectivity options for RDP",
