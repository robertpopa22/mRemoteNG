The `ConnectionTree` uses `SimpleDragSource`, which creates an `OLVDataObject`. This data object currently only populates text and HTML formats, missing the raw `ArrayList` of model objects that `ConnectionWindow` expects for drag-and-drop operations. The fix is to modify `OLVDataObject.cs` to explicitly add the model objects to the data object using `SetData`.\n\n```json\n{",
