The issue is a race condition: `ProtocolBase.CloseBG()` runs on a background thread and tries to `Invoke` back to the UI thread on `ConnectionWindow`, but the window may already be disposed when the panel is closed while a connection is still active. The current `Prot_Event_Closed` has a disposed guard, but `CloseBG` itself can throw `ObjectDisposedException` during the `Invoke` call before reaching that guard.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"Race condition in CloseBG: background thread Invokes on already-disposed ConnectionWindow when panel is closed with active connections.\",\"priority\":\"P2-bug\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/ProtocolBase.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInitiator.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Wrap _interfaceControl.Invoke in CloseBG with try/catch for ObjectDisposedException/InvalidOperationException, and add IsDisposed check before the Invoke call.
