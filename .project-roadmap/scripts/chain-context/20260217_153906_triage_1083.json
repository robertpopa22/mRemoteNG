Looking at the `DisconnectConnection` method (line 898-908), when disconnecting a container (folder), it only iterates over `containerInfo.Children` — the **direct** children. It does NOT recurse into sub-folders. This is exactly what the issue reporter describes: disconnecting a folder only disconnects connections in that folder, not in sub-folders.\n\nThe fix is clear — the disconnect logic needs to recursively traverse sub-folders.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"Folder disconnect only closes direct child connections, not connections in sub-folders — needs recursive traversal\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionContextMenu.cs\"],\"approach\":\"In DisconnectConnection(), when handling ContainerInfo, recursively traverse all descendant containers (not just direct children) to disconnect all connections.
