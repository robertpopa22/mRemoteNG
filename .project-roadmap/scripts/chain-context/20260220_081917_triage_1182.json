The code at `RdpProtocol.cs:1143` simply sets `_rdpClient.AdvancedSettings2.RedirectPrinters = true/false` — a boolean toggle on the Microsoft RDP ActiveX control. This is a known limitation of the `MSTSCLib` ActiveX control vs. the full `mstsc.exe` client; mRemoteNG has no granular control over which printers get redirected. The inconsistency is in Microsoft's COM component behavior, not in mRemoteNG's code.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"Printer redirection inconsistency is a known limitation of the Microsoft RDP ActiveX control (MSTSCLib) vs mstsc.exe — mRemoteNG only sets AdvancedSettings2.RedirectPrinters boolean and has no control over which printers the COM component chooses to redirect\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Cannot fix — the underlying Microsoft RDP ActiveX control handles printer enumeration/redirection internally and does not expose per-printer control.
