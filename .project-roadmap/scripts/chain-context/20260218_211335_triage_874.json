However, the UI does not currently allow adding children to a `ConnectionInfo` node, nor does it easily expose connection properties for Folders in the same way as Connections (though they work if set). The feature request essentially asks to bridge this gap, either by allowing `ConnectionInfo` to have children or by improving the \"Folder as Connection\" experience (e.g., changing icons, \"Convert to Folder\" context menu).\n\n```json\n{\n    \"decision\": \"implement\",\n    \"reason\": \"Technically feasible as ContainerInfo already inherits from ConnectionInfo; the main work is UI/UX to allow connections to have children or to easily convert between types while preserving properties.\",\n    \"priority\": \"P3-enhancement\",\n    \"estimated_files\": [\n        \"mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs\",\n        \"mRemoteNG/Container/ContainerInfo.cs\",\n        \"mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionTree/ConnectionTree.cs\"\n    ],\n    \"approach\": \"Refactor ConnectionInfo to support children (merging ContainerInfo capabilities) or add a 'Convert to Folder/Connection' context menu action that preserves properties.\"\n}\n```\n",
