This is an inconsistency in the two code paths.\n\nThe previous Claude attempt (timed out) was heading toward MRU ordering which is an overengineering — the actual fix is simpler: ensure the logoff/protocol-disconnect code path activates the adjacent tab just like manual tab close does.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"Bug where logging off from a connection activates the first tab instead of the adjacent tab, unlike manual close which correctly activates the adjacent tab — two code paths with inconsistent post-close focus behavior.\",\"priority\":\"P2-bug\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Find the protocol disconnect/logoff code path that triggers tab closure and ensure it activates the adjacent tab consistently with manual tab-close, rather than falling back to DockPanelSuite default which selects the first tab.\"}\n```",
