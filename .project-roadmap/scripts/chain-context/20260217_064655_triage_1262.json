      "raw_output": "This is a significant feature request — adding native OpenSSH as an alternative SSH provider to replace PuTTY. The SSH protocol implementation (`ProtocolSSH1`, `ProtocolSSH2`) currently inherits from `PuttyBase`, which handles all the PuTTY process management and embedding. Supporting native OpenSSH would require a new protocol base class for console-based SSH, terminal embedding (conhost/Windows Terminal integration), and significant changes to connection handling.\n\nThis is a major architectural enhancement, highly requested (many +1s, comments from 2018-2025), and a maintainer (Kvarkas) confirmed they're looking into removing PuTTY dependency. Given the scope (new protocol provider, terminal embedding, SSH config support), this is a P3 enhancement with substantial implementation effort.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"Highly requested feature (20+ comments, maintainer acknowledged) to use Windows native OpenSSH instead of PuTTY for SSH connections, eliminating bundled PuTTY dependency\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/SSH/Connection.Protocol.SSH2.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/SSH/Connection.Protocol.SSH1.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/PuttyBase.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/ProtocolFactory.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/ProtocolType.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/AbstractConnectionRecord.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Properties/Settings.Designer.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Add new OpenSSH protocol provider that launches native ssh.exe (C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\OpenSSH\\\\ssh.exe) and embeds the console window, similar to how PuttyBase embeds PuTTY.
