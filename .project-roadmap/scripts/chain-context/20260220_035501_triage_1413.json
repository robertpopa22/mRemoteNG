This relates to `KeyboardHookMode = 1` which sends all key combinations (including Alt+Tab) to the remote server when `RedirectKeys` is enabled. This is a known RDP behavior — when keyboard hooking redirects to the remote server, local Alt+Tab can't reach the session.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"When RedirectKeys is enabled, KeyboardHookMode=1 sends Alt+Tab to the remote server, preventing local task switching to the fullscreen RDP session; the fullscreen toolbar or a keyboard hook escape mechanism is needed\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/FullscreenToolbar.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Add handling so that when RDP is in fullscreen mode, either the fullscreen toolbar provides a clickable way to release focus, or implement a configurable keyboard shortcut (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Break which is standard RDP escape) that toggles fullscreen off, allowing Alt+Tab to work locally.
