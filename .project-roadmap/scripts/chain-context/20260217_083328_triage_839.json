A maintainer confirmed RDCMan v2.7 support was being added in v1.76. The reporter later confirmed it worked (with a quirk about importing into sub-folders). Another user had a separate issue with encrypted passwords in the `.rdg` file. The original reporter closed the loop saying \"this is not an issue anymore.\"\n\n**Current code state:** The `RemoteDesktopConnectionManagerDeserializer.cs` already supports both schema version 1 (RDCMan v2.2) and schema version 3 (RDCMan v2.7), and also version 2.83. There are comprehensive tests in `RemoteDesktopConnectionManager27DeserializerTests.cs` and `RemoteDesktopConnectionManagerDeserializerTests.cs`. The fix was already shipped.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"RDCMan v2.7 import support was already added in v1.76 and the original reporter confirmed the issue was resolved; current code handles schema v1 (2.2) and v3 (2.7/2.83) with comprehensive tests\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/MiscSerializers/RemoteDesktopConnectionManagerDeserializer.cs\"],\"approach\":\"No fix needed — already resolved in existing codebase.
