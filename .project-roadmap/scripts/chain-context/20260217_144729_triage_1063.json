But the `ModelFilter` (`ConnectionTreeSearchTextFilter`) only matches `ConnectionInfo` objects by name/hostname/description — it does **not** match `ContainerInfo` (folder) objects\n3. So when a folder is collapsed, the filter hides it, and `ExpandAll()` can't see it to expand it\n\nThe fix needs to happen in `ConnectionTree.ExpandAll()` — it should temporarily disable filtering, expand all, then re-apply the filter. Or better yet, the filter should be updated to also include container nodes that have matching children.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"ExpandAll only expands currently visible/filtered nodes; collapsed folders with matching children are skipped because the filter excludes ContainerInfo objects\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionTree/ConnectionTree.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionTree/ConnectionTreeSearchTextFilter.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Override ExpandAll() in ConnectionTree to temporarily remove the ModelFilter, call base.ExpandAll() to expand all branches in the tree model, then re-apply the filter so that matching children inside previously-collapsed folders become visible\"}\n```\n",
