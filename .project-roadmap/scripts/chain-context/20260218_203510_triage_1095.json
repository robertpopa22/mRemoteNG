When \"Connect without credentials\" is used, the `ConnectionInitiator` clones the connection and clears username/domain/password (lines 108-122). However, the tab title is built from `connectionInfo.Username` and `connectionInfo.Domain` at lines 591-604 of `ConnectionWindow.cs`. Since the clone has empty credentials, the tab shows `()` — but the actual credentials entered by the user in the RDP logon dialog are never captured back to update the tab title. The stored/saved credentials still appear because the tab title is set at connection creation time using the original connection's properties.\n\nThe key file is `ConnectionWindow.cs` where the tab text is built, and potentially the protocol classes (like `RdpProtocol.cs`) which could provide the actual connected credentials.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"Tab title shows saved credentials instead of actual connected credentials when using 'Connect without credentials' option\",\"priority\":\"P2-bug\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\"],\"approach\":\"When NoCredentials force flag is used, the cloned ConnectionInfo has empty username/domain.
