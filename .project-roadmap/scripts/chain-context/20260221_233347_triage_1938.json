I need to look for existing import mechanisms or where connection data is handled. I'll use `grep_search` to find files related to \"import\" or \"serializer\" within the `mRemoteNG` directory.\n\nSearching for \"import\" in `mRemoteNG` directory.\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"implement\",\n  \"reason\": \"Implement a feature to allow importing connection details from a simple text file into mRemoteNG.\",\n  \"priority\": \"P3-enhancement\",\n  \"estimated_files\": [\n    \"mRemoteNG/UI/Window/PortScanWindow.cs\",\n    \"mRemoteNG/UI/Window/PortScanWindow.Designer.cs\",\n    \"mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/MiscSerializers/TextListDeserializer.cs\",\n    \"mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs\",\n    \"mRemoteNGTests/Config/Serializers/MiscSerializers/TextListDeserializerTests.cs\"\n  ],\n  \"approach\": \"Add a new menu item 'Import from Text File' within the PortScanWindow or a similar import-related UI.
