Mapping Guacamole's connection types (RDP, VNC, SSH, Telnet) to mRemoteNG protocols\n4. Potentially bidirectional sync\n\nThis is a significant feature with no existing code support, no duplicate, and low demand (zero comments, 8+ years old). It's a \"nice to have\" integration rather than a core bug or security issue.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"Large-scope integration requiring new DB provider for Apache Guacamole schema with no community demand (zero comments since 2017); better served by Guacamole's own web client or manual export/import\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Config/DataProviders/GuacamoleDataProvider.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Config/Connections/GuacamoleDeserializer.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Would require a new GuacamoleDataProvider reading from Guacamole's MySQL/PostgreSQL schema, mapping connection types to mRemoteNG protocols — too large and niche for current roadmap\"}\n```\n",
