      "raw_output": "Now I have the full picture. The issue reports that typing uppercase hostnames in Quick Connect lowercases them. Looking at `ConnectionsService.cs:89`, `UriBuilder.Host = connectionString` — .NET's `UriBuilder.Host` setter normalizes to lowercase per RFC 3986. However, at line 99, `newConnectionInfo.Hostname = connectionString` uses the **original** local variable (not the UriBuilder's lowercased value), so in the current code the case is actually preserved. The `UriBuilder` is only used for port parsing.\n\nThis bug may have been present in an older version where the hostname was read back from `uriBuilder.Host`, but in the current codebase it appears to already be fixed. A test for uppercase hostname preservation should be added to confirm and close.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"UriBuilder.Host lowercases hostnames per RFC 3986, but current code already uses original connectionString for Hostname — likely fixed; needs a test to confirm and close.\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionsService.cs\",\"mRemoteNGTests/Connection/ConnectionsServiceQuickConnectTests.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Add a test with an uppercase hostname (e.g. 'MYSERVER') to CreateQuickConnect and assert the hostname preserves case.
