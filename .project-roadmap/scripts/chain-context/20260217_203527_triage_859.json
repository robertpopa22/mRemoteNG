Since `AxMsRdpClient` (the RDP ActiveX control) relies on the UI thread's message pump to handle network traffic and keep-alives for *all* active RDP sessions, a blocking operation (like a synchronous DNS lookup, a timeout in `Connect()`, or a long loop in `InitializeActiveXControl`) would prevent other controls from processing messages, causing the remote servers to drop the connections due to timeout.\n\nThis is a structural limitation of hosting multiple `AxMsRdpClient` instances in a single UI thread.\n\n```json\n{\n\"decision\": \"needs_info\",\n\"reason\": \"Suspect failing connection blocks UI thread, starving message pump for other active RDP sessions; need logs to confirm blocking behavior.\",\n\"priority\": \"P2-bug\",\n\"estimated_files\": [\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\"],\n\"approach\": \"Investigate if Initialize or Connect blocks UI thread.
