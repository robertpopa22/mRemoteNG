Windows 2012 R2 (RDP 8+) sessions consume more resources (memory and handles) than older versions, causing the 2GB/3GB virtual address space of the 32-bit process to be depleted faster. The recommended solution is to use the 64-bit version of mRemoteNG, which has a much larger address space, or to reduce memory usage by disabling features like \"Cache Bitmaps\" in the connection properties. Since I cannot verify the user's version or environment, additional information is required.\n\n```json\n{\n\"decision\": \"needs_info\",\n\"reason\": \"Likely memory exhaustion (32-bit limit) or GDI handle exhaustion due to higher resource usage of RDP 8+ (Win 2012 R2+); please confirm if using the 64-bit version and if disabling 'Cache Bitmaps' helps.\",\n\"priority\": \"P2-bug\",\n\"estimated_files\": [\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\"],\n\"approach\": \"Verify if the user is on the x86 build; if so, recommend switching to x64.
