      "raw_output": "Based on the analysis of `RdpProtocol.cs` and `ProtocolBase.cs`, the `tmrReconnect` timer is a `System.Timers.Timer` which raises its `Elapsed` event on a background thread. However, the event handler `tmrReconnect_Elapsed` in `RdpProtocol.cs` directly accesses the `ReconnectGroup` UI control and calls `_rdpClient.Connect()` on the ActiveX control, which was created on the UI thread. This causes a cross-thread operation violation, leading to undefined behavior, potential crashes, or connection drops, especially when the \"Reconnect on disconnect\" option is enabled. Switching to `System.Windows.Forms.Timer` will ensure the reconnection logic runs on the UI thread.\n\n```json\n{\n\"decision\": \"implement\",\n\"reason\": \"The reconnect timer runs on a background thread but accesses UI/ActiveX controls, causing cross-thread violations that likely drop connections; switching to System.Windows.Forms.Timer fixes this.\",\n\"priority\": \"P2-bug\",\n\"estimated_files\": [\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/ProtocolBase.cs\", \"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\"],\n\"approach\": \"Change tmrReconnect to System.Windows.Forms.Timer in ProtocolBase.cs and update the event handler signature in RdpProtocol.cs to use EventArgs.\"\n}\n```\n",
