To fully support activity signaling (e.g., on bell or output), we need to detect when the embedded PuTTY window requests attention (flashes) or use a more robust detection mechanism, and then set the existing `HasUnreadActivity` flag on the `ConnectionTab`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"implement\",\n  \"reason\": \"Current SSH activity signaling relies solely on window title changes; users require notifications for output/bell events which are currently missed by the embedded PuTTY window.\",\n  \"priority\": \"P3-enhancement\",\n  \"estimated_files\": [\n    \"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/PuttyBase.cs\",\n    \"mRemoteNG/UI/Tabs/ConnectionTab.cs\"\n  ],\n  \"approach\": \"Enhance PuttyBase to detect window flash/bell events from the embedded process and toggle the HasUnreadActivity property on the ConnectionTab.\"\n}\n```\n",
