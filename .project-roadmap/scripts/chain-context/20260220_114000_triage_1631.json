This is an **external tool limitation** — CRD is known to have issues with modifier key scancodes (particularly right-shift, which uses a different scancode than left-shift). mRemoteNG itself doesn't intercept or remap shift keys at the application level; it relies on standard Windows keyboard input. The RDP keyboard hook in `RdpProtocol.cs` only controls whether keyboard shortcuts are redirected to the remote session, not scancode translation.\n\nThis is a Chrome Remote Desktop bug/limitation, not something mRemoteNG can fix.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"Right shift key handling is a known Chrome Remote Desktop limitation in scancode translation — mRemoteNG uses standard Windows keyboard input and does not remap modifier keys\",\"priority\":\"P4-debt\",\"estimated_files\":[],\"approach\":\"External tool issue — Chrome Remote Desktop doesn't correctly translate right-shift scancodes. mRemoteNG has no custom keyboard scancode handling that could work around this.
