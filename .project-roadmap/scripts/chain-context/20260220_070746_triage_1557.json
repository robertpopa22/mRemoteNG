      "raw_output": "Based on my analysis of the issue and codebase:\n\n- **Issue #1557**: On FIPS-enabled Windows, `LegacyRijndaelCryptographyProvider` uses `MD5.Create()` for key derivation (line 39-41), which was non-FIPS-compliant on .NET Framework. The code already migrated from `RijndaelManaged` to `Aes.Create()`, but MD5 remains.\n- **On .NET 10** (current target): Both `Aes.Create()` and `MD5.Create()` use CNG providers (FIPS-validated), so the runtime issue is largely resolved. However, the `CompatibilityChecker` still warns, and the legacy MD5 key derivation is architecturally weak.\n- **The modern `AeadCryptographyProvider`** already uses PBKDF2 via BouncyCastle — the correct approach.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"LegacyRijndaelCryptographyProvider uses MD5 key derivation which fails on FIPS-enabled systems; .NET 10 CNG mitigates runtime crashes but CompatibilityChecker still warns and MD5 is architecturally weak\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Security/SymmetricEncryption/LegacyRijndaelCryptographyProvider.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/App/CompatibilityChecker.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/OptionsPages/CredentialsPage.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Update CompatibilityChecker to skip FIPS warning on .NET 5+ (CNG is FIPS-validated); optionally replace MD5 key derivation in LegacyRijndaelCryptographyProvider with SHA256 for new encryptions while keeping MD5 decryption path for backward compatibility\"}\n```\n",
