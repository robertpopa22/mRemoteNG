However, the codebase **already has** a `DesktopScaleFactor` setting (`RdpProtocol.cs:46-63`) with `Auto`, `100%`, `125%`, `150%`, and `200%` options. The `Auto` mode reads the system's DPI via `ResolutionScalingFactor`. A commenter (VShawn) showed it working correctly at 4K + 200% zoom back in 2020. The issue is from July 2020 with no activity since mid-2021.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"needs_info\",\"reason\":\"DesktopScaleFactor with Auto mode already exists in RdpProtocol — need confirmation if issue persists in current version with Auto setting enabled\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol9.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/UI/DPI_Per_Monitor.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Feature exists — verify if reporter was unaware of DesktopScaleFactor setting or if Auto detection fails for specific multi-monitor/per-monitor DPI scenarios\"}\n```\n",
