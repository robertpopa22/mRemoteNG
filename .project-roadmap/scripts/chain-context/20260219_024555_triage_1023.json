This resulted in RDP sessions using logical resolution instead of physical resolution in fullscreen mode.\n\n**Changes applied:**\n- Modified `mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs`:\n    - Replaced dependency on `DisplayProperties` with a direct calculation using `FrmMain.DeviceDpi`.\n    - Added a `ResolutionScalingFactor` property that correctly computes the scaling factor for the monitor where the main window resides.\n    - Updated `SetResolution` to use this new property for calculating `DesktopWidth` and `DesktopHeight` in fullscreen mode.\n    - Removed unused `_displayProperties` field and initialization.\n    - Added `using System.Drawing;` for `SizeF` usage.\n\n**Verification:**\n- Successfully built the project (`build.ps1`).\n- The logic now correctly scales logical screen bounds by the specific monitor's DPI factor (e.g., 1920x1080 * 2.0 = 3840x2160), ensuring crisp fullscreen RDP sessions on high-DPI displays.\n",
