PuTTY does not natively support an interactive \"Find\" dialog for its scrollback buffer within the window itself, nor does mRemoteNG have direct access to the process's memory/buffer.\n\nHowever, `PuttyBase.cs` already contains a method `CopyAllToClipboard()` which sends the `0x0170` (Copy All) command to the PuTTY window. This allows extracting the full session text.\n\nTherefore, the feature can be implemented by extracting the text and searching it in a separate mRemoteNG-controlled window.\n\n```json\n{\n\"decision\": \"implement\",\n\"reason\": \"Direct search within the hosted PuTTY window is not supported by the external process.
