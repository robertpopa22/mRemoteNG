Updating `ConnectionTree` to pass multiple selected items to `ConfigWindow`.\n2.  Updating `ConfigWindow` to handle a list of connections.\n3.  Updating `ConnectionInfoPropertyGrid` to support `SelectedObjects` (plural) and adapt the property filtering logic (likely ensuring all selected items are compatible or intersecting properties).\n\nThis is a standard enhancement.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"Valid feature request to allow editing multiple connections simultaneously.
