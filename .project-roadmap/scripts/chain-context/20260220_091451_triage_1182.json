This is the correct and only standard API for printer redirection. The native `mstsc.exe` client uses a different, more complete RDP stack that handles printer enumeration differently than the ActiveX control.\n- **This is a known limitation of the Microsoft RDP ActiveX control**, not a bug in mRemoteNG's code.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"Incomplete printer redirection is a known limitation of the Microsoft RDP ActiveX control (MsTscAx) vs the native mstsc.exe client; mRemoteNG correctly sets RedirectPrinters=true which is the only API available\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\"],\"approach\":\"No fix available — the AdvancedSettings2.RedirectPrinters boolean is the only printer redirection API exposed by the ActiveX control.
