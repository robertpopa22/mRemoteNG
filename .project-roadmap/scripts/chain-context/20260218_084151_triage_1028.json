The contributor `sparerd` already identified this in 2018 — the error \"server's authentication policy does not allow connection requests using saved credentials\" is caused by the target server's GPO settings, not by mRemoteNG. The built-in Windows RDP client may behave differently due to NLA/CredSSP negotiation differences, but the root cause is on the server side. The issue has been stale since 2018 with no reporter follow-up.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"Server-side Group Policy issue (CredSSP/NLA saved credentials delegation) — not an mRemoteNG bug, as identified by contributor sparerd in 2018; no reporter follow-up since then\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[],\"approach\":\"Close as not-a-bug/server-side configuration issue; the RDP server's GPO must allow delegating saved credentials via CredSSP\"}\n```\n",
