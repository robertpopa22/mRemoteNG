When a connection fails, `Close()` spawns a background thread (`CloseBG`) which accesses `tmrReconnect` (a `System.Windows.Forms.Timer` that must be accessed from the UI thread) and fires `ClosedEvent` (which modifies the non-thread-safe `_activeConnections` list) without marshalling to the UI thread. This cross-thread access can corrupt the message pump or shared state, destabilizing other active RDP connections.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"ProtocolBase.CloseBG accesses UI components (tmrReconnect) and fires events modifying shared collections from a background thread, causing race conditions and potential stability issues.\",\"priority\":\"P2-bug\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG\\\\Connection\\\\Protocol\\\\ProtocolBase.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Refactor CloseBG to marshal thread-unsafe operations to the UI thread.\"}\n```\n",
