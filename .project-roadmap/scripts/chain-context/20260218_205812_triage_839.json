The residual issue is that password-protected entries in .rdg files can cause import failures (one user confirmed removing the password fixed it)\n3. The code now handles `DecryptRdcManPassword` with try/catch returning empty string, so password decryption failures shouldn't crash\n4. The `VerifyFileVersion` already accepts `>= 2.7` for programVersion attribute\n5. The issue is 8+ years old, reporter confirmed it worked, and a triage refresh was already posted asking for retest\n\nThis is a stale issue that was largely fixed. The remaining concern (newer RDCMan versions) is already handled by the `>= 2.7` check. The password issue has a graceful fallback.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"Issue was resolved in 2017 alpha build (v2.7 import support added); reporter confirmed it works; residual password decryption failures already have graceful fallback returning empty string; 8+ years stale with no recent reproduction\",\"priority\":\"P4-debt\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/MiscSerializers/RemoteDesktopConnectionManagerDeserializer.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Close as stale/resolved — RDCMan v2.7+ import works, password decryption has try/catch fallback, no actionable reproduction steps remain after triage refresh request\"}\n```\n",
