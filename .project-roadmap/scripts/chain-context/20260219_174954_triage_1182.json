The boolean `RedirectPrinters` property on the MSTSC ActiveX control is a simple on/off toggle — it doesn't offer the same level of printer enumeration and redirection that the full `mstsc.exe` client does. This is a Microsoft RDP ActiveX control limitation, not a bug in mRemoteNG's code. The code correctly passes the setting through. The discrepancy in printer counts between servers is due to server-side printer driver availability combined with how the ActiveX control negotiates printer redirection differently than `mstsc.exe`.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"RDP ActiveX control (MSTSCLib) has known limitations in printer redirection compared to full mstsc.exe client — this is a Microsoft COM component limitation, not an mRemoteNG bug\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\"],\"approach\":\"The RedirectPrinters boolean is correctly passed to AdvancedSettings2.RedirectPrinters.
