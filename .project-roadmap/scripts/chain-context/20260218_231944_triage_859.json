      "raw_output": "The issue describes a scenario where a failure to establish a new RDP connection causes all existing RDP connections to drop. This is symptomatic of the main UI thread being blocked, causing the RDP ActiveX controls (which rely on the UI thread's message pump for keep-alives) to time out and disconnect.\n\nRecent changes in v1.80+ introduced `InitializeAsync` to move initialization off the main thread, which may have resolved some blocking issues. However, the actual `_rdpClient.Connect()` call is still synchronous and must run on the UI thread due to ActiveX/COM limitations. If the RDP client itself blocks during `Connect()` (e.g., DNS resolution or network timeouts handled internally by the control), it could still cause this behavior.\n\nSince `AxMsRdpClient` methods must be called on the UI thread, there is no easy code fix to make `Connect()` asynchronous if the control itself blocks. The best course of action is to verify if the issue persists with the recent async initialization improvements or if it is specific to certain network conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n\"decision\": \"needs_info\",\n\"reason\": \"This behavior typically indicates UI thread starvation causing RDP keep-alive timeouts.
