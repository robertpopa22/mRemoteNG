      "raw_output": "Now I have a clear picture. The issue requests the ability to hide connection tabs. The codebase already has `AlwaysShowPanelTabs` which controls tab visibility, but there's a commented-out `HideTabsMode = HideAlways` in ConnectionWindow.cs. The feature is essentially about adding a \"hide tabs\" option (the inverse of \"always show panel tabs\"). Looking at the existing code, there's already infrastructure for this - `AlwaysShowPanelTabs` exists and `HideTabsModes.HideAlways` is available but commented out. The original author even submitted a PR that was merged but got lost during the MagicLib removal.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"Users want to hide connection tab strip for RDCMan-like workflow; existing AlwaysShowPanelTabs infrastructure is already in place and HideAlways mode exists but is commented out\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/frmMain.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/OptionsPages/TabsPanelsPage.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/OptionsPages/TabsPanelsPage.Designer.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Config/Settings/SettingsLoader.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Expose a 'Hide connection tabs' option in TabsPanels settings page (inverse of AlwaysShowPanelTabs or a new setting).
