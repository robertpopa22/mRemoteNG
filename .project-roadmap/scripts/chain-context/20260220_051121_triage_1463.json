The `GetAttributeAsBool()` returns `false` for missing attributes, so connections that previously had \"inherit everything\" lose inheritance on newly-added fields. This is a schema migration gap — no version upgrader sets new inheritance booleans to `true` for connections where all existing ones were `true`.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"New config fields default to InheritX=false when loaded from older XML/SQL configs missing the attribute, breaking existing inherit-all setups\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializers/Xml/XmlConnectionsDeserializer.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializers/Sql/DataTableDeserializer.cs\"],\"approach\":\"In the deserializer, after loading all inheritance properties, detect missing XML attributes for new fields and default them to true when all other inheritance booleans are already true (i.e. the connection was using inherit-all before upgrade)\"}\n```\n",
