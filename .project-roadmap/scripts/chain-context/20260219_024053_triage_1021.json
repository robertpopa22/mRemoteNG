The project uses `PerMonitorV2` awareness (in `ProgramRoot.cs`) but `FrmMain.cs` does not explicitly handle `WM_DPICHANGED`, relying on the framework and library. Without reproduction steps including specific monitor resolutions and DPI settings, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact failure mode (e.g., coordinates becoming negative, size becoming zero, or rendering failure).\n\n```json\n{\n    \"decision\": \"needs_info\",\n    \"reason\": \"Likely a DPI scaling issue with DockPanelSuite on multi-monitor setups; requires specific environment details (resolutions, DPI) to reproduce.\",\n    \"priority\": \"P2-bug\",\n    \"estimated_files\": [\n        \"mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/frmMain.cs\",\n        \"mRemoteNG/UI/DPI_Per_Monitor.cs\"\n    ],\n    \"approach\": \"Investigate DPI handling in FrmMain.cs and potential conflicts with DockPanelSuite's PerMonitorV2 support; consider implementing explicit WM_DPICHANGED handling.\"\n}\n```\n",
