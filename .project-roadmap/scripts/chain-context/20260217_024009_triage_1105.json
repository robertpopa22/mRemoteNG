The application uses **WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking (DockPanelSuite)** as its docking framework, which already provides built-in panel docking, resizing, and snapping behavior. Enhancing this would require either:\n\n1. Customizing DockPanelSuite's drag/resize behavior (complex, deep into the library)\n2. Adding overlay snap zones or keyboard shortcuts for panel management\n3. Upgrading DockPanelSuite to a newer version with better snapping\n\nThis is a **nice-to-have enhancement** with an empty issue body (no specific requirements), making it low priority and hard to scope.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"Panel resizing/snapping is handled by DockPanelSuite library; enhancing it requires deep modifications to the third-party docking framework with no specific requirements provided in the empty issue body\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/frmMain.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/UI/Panels/PanelAdder.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Would require customizing WeifenLuo DockPanelSuite internals or adding keyboard-driven panel resize shortcuts; not actionable without specific requirements\"}\n```\n",
