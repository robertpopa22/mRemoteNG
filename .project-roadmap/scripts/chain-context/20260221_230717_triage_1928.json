      "raw_output": "I will begin by searching for files related to drag-and-drop functionality within the `mRemoteNG` project, focusing on UI and tree-related components to identify potential files that might be affected by issue #1928. I'll use a case-insensitive search for \"drag\" and \"drop\" in the `mRemoteNG/UI/Controls` and `mRemoteNG/Tree` directories.\nMy initial search didn't find \"drag\" or \"drop\" in the `mRemoteNG/UI/Controls` or `mRemoteNG/Tree` directories. I'll now examine `mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionTree.cs` directly, as it's a prime candidate for handling connection drag-and-drop functionality, to determine if it contains relevant event handlers or code.\nI need to locate `ConnectionTree.cs` correctly using `glob`. Once found, I'll read its content to understand its drag-and-drop implementation. If necessary, I'll then expand my search for \"drag\" and \"drop\" across all C# files in the `mRemoteNG` directory.\nFound `mRemoteNG\\UI\\Controls\\ConnectionTree\\ConnectionTree.cs`. Reading content to find drag-and-drop code.\nI've identified `ConnectionTreeDragAndDropHandler` as the key class for drag-and-drop events in `ConnectionTree.cs`. My next step is to locate and inspect `ConnectionTreeDragAndDropHandler.cs` using `glob`.\nFound `mRemoteNG\\Tree\\ConnectionTreeDragAndDropHandler.cs`. Reading content now to understand the \"Drag and drop connection problem\".\nI've analyzed `ConnectionTreeDragAndDropHandler.cs` and identified it as the central point for drag-and-drop logic, including event handling, drop operations, and validation. Without further details on the \"Drag and drop connection problem,\" I've deduced that the issue likely stems from logical flaws within this handler, unexpected settings, or UI-related feedback. Given the nature of the problem affecting core UI interaction, I will categorize it as a P2-bug. My proposed fix involves examining `ConnectionTreeDragAndDropHandler.cs` and `ConnectionTree.cs` for logical errors or UI update issues, and potentially `ConnectionInfo.cs",
