      "raw_output": "Now I have a clear picture. Looking at the code:\n\n1. **`VerifyFileVersion`** (line 59-86): For the `programVersion` attribute path (v2.7+ files), it only rejects versions `< 2.7`, which is actually reasonable. But for the `<version>` node path (v2.2 files), it requires an **exact match** of `2.2` — any other version is rejected.\n\n2. The real issue from the comments: a user reported that a **saved password** in the `.rdg` file caused the import to fail — deleting that password made it work. This points to `DecryptRdcManPassword` throwing an exception that isn't caught at the import level, or password decryption issues causing an unhandled error in the broader import flow.\n\n3. The issue was reported in 2017 for v1.75 (which only supported v2.2 schema), and v2.7 support was added later. The original reporter confirmed it worked after the alpha. Another user confirmed the saved password was the root cause.\n\nThe issue is largely resolved for recent builds (v2.7 support was added), but the password decryption failure could still cause a generic \"error while importing\" if exceptions propagate. The `DecryptRdcManPassword` already catches exceptions and returns empty string, so password decryption alone shouldn't crash. The issue is stale.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"Issue from 2017 was caused by missing RDCMan v2.7 support which was added in v1.76; the original reporter confirmed it was fixed, and the remaining password decryption edge case already has proper exception handling returning empty string.\",\"priority\":\"P4-debt\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/MiscSerializers/RemoteDesktopConnectionManagerDeserializer.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Close as resolved — v2.7 import support has been present since v1.76.
