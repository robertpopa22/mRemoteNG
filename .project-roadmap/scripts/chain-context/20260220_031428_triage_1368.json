The crash occurs in the `ReinitializeSqlUpdater()` → `LoadConnections()` path. Looking at the current code in our fork, this area has been significantly reworked with proper error handling, the `SqlConnectionsSaver` safety checks (commit `5a3add675`), and the `RemoteConnectionsSyncronizer` pattern. The issue is from a very old version and the code path has been substantially improved.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"Reported against v1.76 (2019); the SQL options save/load path has been completely reworked in v1.80+ with proper error handling in ReinitializeSqlUpdater, SqlConnectionsSaver safety checks, and RemoteConnectionsSyncronizer lifecycle management\",\"priority\":\"P2-bug\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/OptionsPages/SqlServerPage.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionsService.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Already fixed in current codebase — SQL initialization path now has proper exception handling and the SqlConnectionsSaver prevents saving on failed initial load\"}\n```\n",
