      "raw_output": "Based on my analysis, the issue is about RDP `LoadBalanceInfo` causing \"An internal error has occurred\" when connecting. The comments show the root cause is a UTF-16 vs UTF-8 encoding issue — the ActiveX RDP control expects UTF-8 bytes but .NET passes UTF-16. A fix already exists via the `UseUtf8LoadBalanceInfo` option, but users still report problems (e.g., the connection drops after 1-5 seconds even with UTF-8 enabled). The `\\r\\n` suffix handling and encoding are fragile.\n\nLooking at the comment thread: the original reporter got it working with `Use UTF8 encoding` option in v1.76.3, but another user (@Shooshka) still had issues — connection closes silently after 1-5 seconds with UTF-8 enabled. The issue remains open.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"RDP LoadBalanceInfo encoding is fragile — the UTF-8 option exists but doesn't reliably handle all RDS farm configurations, and the \\\\r\\\\n suffix logic needs hardening\",\"priority\":\"P2-bug\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/AzureLoadBalanceInfoEncoder.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Harden the AzureLoadBalanceInfoEncoder to always ensure proper \\\\r\\\\n termination (strip existing suffixes before appending), make UTF-8 encoding the default for LoadBalanceInfo (most servers expect it), and improve error messaging when LoadBalanceInfo connection fails\"}\n```\n",
