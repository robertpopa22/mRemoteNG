The user wants Ctrl+/- or Ctrl+Scroll to increase font size in open terminal sessions for better visibility during presentations/screen sharing. The discussion clarifies this is specifically about SSH/console connections, not RDP.\n\nThis is a legitimate enhancement but requires modifying PuTTY integration (font size is controlled by PuTTY session settings), which is non-trivial. The PuTTY embedded window doesn't easily expose runtime font-size controls — it would need either:\n1. Sending PuTTY config change commands at runtime, or\n2. A DPI/transform scaling approach on the hosting panel\n\nThis is a P3 enhancement with moderate complexity.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"Useful presentation feature for SSH/console connections - zoom via Ctrl+/- to increase terminal font size during demos\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/PuttyBase.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs\",\"mRemoteNG/UI/Tabs/ConnectionTab.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Add Ctrl+/- keyboard handler on connection tabs that sends font-size change to embedded PuTTY window via WM_SETFONT or PuTTY config reload; scope to SSH/Telnet console protocols only, not RDP\"}\n```\n",
