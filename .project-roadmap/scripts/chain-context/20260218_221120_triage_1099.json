When enabled, this property configures the WebView2 control to use a persistent user data folder located at `%AppData%\\mRemoteNG\\BrowserProfiles\\{ConnectionID}`, effectively preserving browser state, cookies, and saved passwords across sessions. This property is exposed in the UI for HTTP/HTTPS connections.\n\nTherefore, no new code is required. The issue should be closed as \"Implemented\" or \"Works as Designed\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"wontfix\",\n  \"reason\": \"The 'Use Persistent Browser' option already exists for HTTP/HTTPS connections, enabling password persistence via a stable user data folder.\",\n  \"priority\": \"P3-enhancement\",\n  \"estimated_files\": [],\n  \"approach\": \"Close issue as implemented.\"\n}\n```\n",
