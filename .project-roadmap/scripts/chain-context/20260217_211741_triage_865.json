This is likely the cause of the issue, as the window restoration might not be complete when the event fires. The fix involves deferring the resize operation.\n\n```json\n{\n\"decision\":\"implement\",\n\"reason\":\"The PuTTY window resize on resume likely conflicts with the window restoration process; deferring the resize via BeginInvoke should allow the UI to settle first.\",\n\"priority\":\"P2-bug\",\n\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/PuttyBase.cs\"],\n\"approach\":\"Modify OnPowerModeChanged in PuttyBase.cs to wrap the Resize call in InterfaceControl.BeginInvoke to ensure it runs after the main UI thread has finished processing the resume event.\"\n}\n```\n",
