It requires invitation files or Easy Connect, making it fundamentally different from the protocols mRemoteNG currently embeds.\n- SCCM Remote Control requires a ConfigMgr infrastructure and is not a standalone protocol.\n- There's no practical way to embed these as a panel-integrated protocol. At best, mRemoteNG could launch `msra.exe` as an external tool, which is already possible via the External Tools feature.\n- The issue has been open 8+ years with no concrete implementation path proposed by anyone.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"wontfix\",\"reason\":\"Microsoft Remote Assistance (msra.exe) and SCCM Remote Control cannot be embedded as panel protocols — they lack embeddable COM/ActiveX controls and require invitation-based workflows incompatible with mRemoteNG's connection model; launching msra.exe is already possible via External Tools.\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[],\"approach\":\"Close as wontfix — no embeddable API exists for Remote Assistance; users can already use External Tools to launch msra.exe with connection parameters.\"}\n```\n",
