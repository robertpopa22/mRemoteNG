      "raw_output": "The issue is clear. When using SmartSize on a multi-monitor setup with different DPI scaling (e.g., primary 150%, secondary 100%), the RDP session gets the wrong resolution because `ResolutionScalingFactor` uses `_frmMain.DeviceDpi` — which reflects the **main form's monitor DPI**, not the **monitor where the RDP tab is actually displayed**. This causes the resolution to be scaled incorrectly (1920×1080 at 150% = ~2880×1620, close to the reported 2386×1473).\n\nFor SmartSize mode (lines 1080-1081), the `InterfaceControl.Size` is used directly (unscaled panel size), which should be correct. But the real issue is the `ResolutionScalingFactor` being used for Fullscreen mode and potentially affecting SmartSize when DPI awareness isn't handled per-monitor.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"SmartSize uses wrong DPI scaling on multi-monitor setups with mixed DPI — ResolutionScalingFactor reads main form DPI instead of the actual monitor's DPI where the RDP control is hosted.\",\"priority\":\"P2-bug\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/RDP/RdpProtocol.cs\"],\"approach\":\"Change ResolutionScalingFactor to use the DPI of the monitor where the InterfaceControl (or its parent ConnectionWindow) is actually displayed, rather than _frmMain.DeviceDpi.
