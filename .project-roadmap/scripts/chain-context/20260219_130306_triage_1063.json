      "raw_output": "The `ExpandAll` button is already wired to `UserExpandAll()`. The `UserExpandAll()` method calls `base.ExpandAll()` which operates on the ObjectListView — this only expands visible (filtered) nodes. But it then updates `_preFilterExpandedObjects` to include ALL containers, so when the filter is removed, everything stays expanded.\n\nThe real issue is that `ExpandAll()` on a filtered ObjectListView/TreeListView can only expand nodes that pass the filter — hidden nodes aren't in the view. The current `UserExpandAll()` is actually a reasonable workaround (it marks all containers as expanded for post-filter state).\n\nThe core limitation is in ObjectListView's `TreeListView.ExpandAll()` — it can only act on visible/filtered nodes. This appears to already have been addressed with the `UserExpandAll()` method.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"ExpandAll during filtering only expands visible nodes in the TreeListView; hidden filtered-out folders remain collapsed when the filter is cleared, despite UserExpandAll updating pre-filter state\",\"priority\":\"P3-enhancement\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionTree/ConnectionTree.cs\"],\"approach\":\"In UserExpandAll(), after updating _preFilterExpandedObjects with all containers, temporarily disable filtering, call ExpandAll() on the underlying TreeListView to expand all actual nodes (including previously hidden ones), then re-enable filtering.
