I'll search the codebase for relevant files and then formulate the JSON.\n`grep_search` indicates `ObjectListView` likely underlies the Connections panel, with focus/scrolling logic in `ObjectListView.cs` and `TreeListView.cs`. I'll identify the Connections panel's implementation (probably in `mRemoteNG\\UI\\` or `mRemoteNG\\Tree\\`), analyze its focus management and `ObjectListView` usage, and propose a fix for unwanted scrolling on focus. I'll start by searching for \"ConnectionsPanel\" definition within `mRemoteNG`.\n\"ConnectionsPanel\" returned no `mRemoteNG` results, suggesting an alternative name. `ObjectListView` and `TreeListView` results imply the Connections panel is likely one of those. I'll search `mRemoteNG` UI files for `TreeListView` and `ObjectListView` instantiations to pinpoint the panel.\n`ConnectionTree.cs` is identified as the \"Connections panel,\" inheriting from `TreeListView`. A comment in `ConnectionTree.cs` hints at a past, possibly related, `ObjectListView` issue. The problem likely stems from `TreeListView`/`ObjectListView` focus-driven scrolling. My next step is to examine `ConnectionTree.cs`, `ConnectionTree.Designer.cs`, and `ObjectListView`'s `TreeListView.cs` to understand focus handling and scrolling behavior for a targeted fix.\n`ConnectionTree.cs` reveals it inherits from `TreeListView` (BrightIdeasSoftware.TreeListView) and uses `EnsureModelVisible` for node visibility, frequently called when adding nodes and filtering. This, along with comments about past `ObjectListView` issues, points to `EnsureModelVisible` as the likely culprit for the \"Connections panel scrolling down when focussed\" bug. The scrolling could be triggered by individual node focus or the control itself gaining focus. My next step is to examine `ConnectionTree.Designer.cs` for properties influencing this behavior, as disabling unnecessary scrolling on already visible f",
