      "raw_output": "To address the flickering and hourglass cursor issue when using mRemoteNG with multiple users on a SQL database, the root cause is the aggressive full reload of the connection tree whenever a change is detected.\n\n### Analysis\n1.  **Polling Mechanism:** `RemoteConnectionsSyncronizer` uses a 3-second timer to check for updates via `SqlConnectionsUpdateChecker`.\n2.  **Trigger:** `SqlConnectionsUpdateChecker` compares the local last update timestamp with the database's. If different (and not updated by self), it raises `ConnectionsUpdateAvailable`.\n3.  **Reload Chain:** `RemoteConnectionsSyncronizer` handles this by calling `Runtime.ConnectionsService.LoadConnections`.\n4.  **UI Impact:** `LoadConnections` loads the data (on a background thread) and raises `ConnectionsLoaded`.\n5.  **Critical Bottleneck:** `ConnectionTreeWindow` handles `ConnectionsLoaded` and invokes `ConnectionTree.ConnectionTreeModel` setter on the UI thread.\n6.  **Performance Hit:** The setter calls `PopulateTreeView`, which performs `SetObjects(newModel.RootNodes)` (replacing the entire tree model) and `AutoResizeColumn` (which iterates *every* row and measures text width). This full rebuild and measure operation on the UI thread causes the flicker and the wait cursor/unresponsiveness.\n\n### Plan\nTo fix this, we should:\n1.  **Debounce Updates:** Ensure updates aren't triggered too frequently.\n2.  **Optimize Tree Refresh:** Instead of a full `SetObjects` and `AutoResizeColumn` on every update, implement a difference check (diff) to only update changed nodes, or at least optimize `AutoResizeColumn` to be less expensive (or optional).\n3.  **Async/Background Loading:** Ensure as much preparation as possible is done off the UI thread.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"The SQL provider triggers a full connection tree reload and column resize (iterating all items) every time an update is detected (polled every 3s), causing UI flickering and blocking.\",\"priority\":\"P2-bug\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteN",
