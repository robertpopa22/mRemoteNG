The `ProcessExited` handler (line 69-92) already handles the case where PuTTY *exits* with an error, but the hang occurs because PuTTY *doesn't exit* — it waits for interactive input.\n\n```json\n{\"decision\":\"implement\",\"reason\":\"PuTTY embedded window hangs on auth failure because interactive password retry dialogs block in child-window mode; adding -batch flag when credentials are supplied makes PuTTY exit immediately on failure instead of prompting\",\"priority\":\"P2-bug\",\"estimated_files\":[\"mRemoteNG/Connection/Protocol/PuttyBase.cs\"],\"approach\":\"When SSH credentials are provided via -pw/-pwfile, also pass the PuTTY -batch flag to disable interactive auth prompts — PuTTY will exit with non-zero code on failure, which ProcessExited already handles by prompting to update the stored password\"}\n```\n",
