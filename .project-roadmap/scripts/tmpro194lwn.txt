Fix GitHub issue #1289: [CredManager] Provide a way to save credentials when using the Import feature
Description: 
Approach: Modify 'Import.HeadlessFileImport' (and related methods) to track newly imported nodes. After import, scan these nodes for embedded credentials. If found, prompt the user to migrate them to the Credential Repository. If accepted, iterate through nodes, create CredentialRecords, link them to the connections via ExternalCredentialProvider, and clear embedded credentials.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/App/Import.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Import/MRemoteNGXmlImporter.cs
