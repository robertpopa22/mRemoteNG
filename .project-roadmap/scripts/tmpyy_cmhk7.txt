Fix GitHub issue #1121: [Feature] Quick Connect in CAPS
Description: 
Approach: Modify `CreateQuickConnect` in `ConnectionsService.cs` to attempt parsing the input as a URI. If a scheme is detected (e.g. `rdp://`, `ssh://`), parse the protocol, host, port, and user info from the URI, overriding the selected protocol. Ensure parsing is case-insensitive to support 'RDP://' as requested.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Connection/ConnectionsService.cs, mRemoteNGTests/Connection/ConnectionsServiceQuickConnectTests.cs
