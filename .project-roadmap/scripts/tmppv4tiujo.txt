Fix GitHub issue #1171: Feature Request: Hide Connection Tabs
Description: 
Approach: Re-enable the 'Always Show Connection Tabs' option in settings. Implement logic in ConnectionWindow to toggle tab visibility on the DockPanel, likely by adjusting DocumentStyle or using a custom theme/renderer properties if available in the docking library.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/UI/Window/ConnectionWindow.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/OptionsPages/TabsPanelsPage.cs
