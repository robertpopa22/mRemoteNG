Fix GitHub issue #984: Create link to connection instead of duplicating?

Description:


Recommended approach: Introduce a linked-connection entry that stores a reference to a source connection and resolves shared settings at runtime instead of copying values.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/Tree/ConnectionTreeModel.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Forms/frmMain.cs, mRemoteNG/Config/Serializers/ConnectionSerializer.cs

RULES (CRITICAL):
- Read code BEFORE modifying
- Do NOT change existing behavior â€” only fix the reported issue
- Do NOT create interactive tests (no dialogs, MessageBox, notepad.exe)
- After fixing, run build: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"
- After build passes, run tests: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild
- If YOUR change breaks tests, fix it.  If tests fail for unrelated reasons, ignore.
- Do ONLY the fix.  Nothing else.
