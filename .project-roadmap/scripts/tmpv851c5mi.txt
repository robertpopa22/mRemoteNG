Fix GitHub issue #874: [Feature Request] Allow connections to behave as folders.

Description:


Recommended approach: Investigate allowing ConnectionInfo objects to maintain a list of child connections and update the TreeView to support rendering/expanding connection nodes as parents.
Likely files: mRemoteNG/App/Connection/ConnectionInfo.cs, mRemoteNG/UI/Controls/ConnectionTree.cs, mRemoteNG/App/Tree/ITreeNode.cs

RULES (CRITICAL):
- Read code BEFORE modifying
- Do NOT change existing behavior — only fix the reported issue
- Do NOT create interactive tests (no dialogs, MessageBox, notepad.exe)
- After fixing, run build: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\build.ps1"
- After build passes, run tests: powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "D:\github\mRemoteNG\run-tests.ps1" -NoBuild
- If YOUR change breaks tests, fix it.  If tests fail for unrelated reasons, ignore.
- Do ONLY the fix.  Nothing else.
