Summary
- preserve the active Config/Connections panel restored from persisted dock layout
- avoid forcing Connections panel focus right after layout restore
- keep fallback focus to Connections only when no active dock content exists

Why
Issue #2171 reports Config/Connections panel position or selection not retained after restart.
Startup always called AppWindows.TreeForm.Focus and could override restored active panel state.

Validation
- local shell in this session has no dotnet or msbuild in PATH
- validation is CI and manual repro first for this package
